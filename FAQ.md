# FAQ

## 1. Reggie, why would we hire you to be a VP if we can just use a digital version of you for $20/month?

You wouldn't.

You'd hire me to build digital versions of your OTHER VPs.

Most professionals can't turn expertise into code. I spent 20 years executing 700+ transactions AND documenting the system behind every one.

The rare skill isn't being good at your job. It's architecting your digital twin, then doing it again for your CFO, your asset manager, your acquisitions director.

$20/month gets you what I built. Hiring me gets you the ability to build what doesn't exist yet.

## 2. Reggie, if institutional-grade analysis is now $20/month, what's a real VP actually worth?

Same as always. If they're doing VP work.

VP work is reading markets nobody else sees. Building decade-long relationships. Knowing when to walk. Structuring solutions to impossible problems.

Data entry, spreadsheet formatting, variance reports? That's $20/month work.

The digital VP handles the 70% that's reproducible. The human VP focuses on the 30% that requires 20 years of battle scars.

That VP is worth more than ever. They're finally doing the job they were hired for.

## 3. Reggie, you achieved 51% rent growth with these tools. Why would you hand that competitive advantage to everyone else?

The competitive advantage wasn't the tools. It was knowing I needed them.

In 2020, I managed 4 million square feet alone. Everyone else needed teams of 4-6 people.

The tools don't make you good. The judgment to build tools makes you good.

Most professionals won't use this. They'll keep doing things the old way. The ones who adopt it were already the type who'd figure out how to scale themselves.

I'm not handing out a competitive advantage. I'm handing out a test.

The people who take it were already dangerous. Now they're unstoppable.

## 4. Reggie, isn't this just you automating yourself out of a job?

No. Automating out of the WRONG job to do the RIGHT job.

Before:
- 40% Excel (wrong job)
- 30% admin (wrong job)
- 20% deals (right job)
- 10% strategy (right job)

I was a $180k data entry clerk who occasionally closed deals.

After:
- 10% analytical work (automated)
- 10% documentation (automated)
- 50% deals and relationships
- 30% strategy

Same person. Same skills. 4x impact on what actually matters.

I didn't automate out of a job. I automated into the job I was supposed to have.

## 5. Reggie, you say real estate is about relationships. How does a digital VP help with that?

By giving you back the time to build them.

What kills relationships? Showing up unprepared. Delaying responses. Missing opportunities because you're buried in spreadsheets.

The digital VP is your prep team.

Before every tenant call:
- `/tenant-credit` → their financial position
- `/relative-valuation` → your competitive standing
- `/effective-rent` → your walkaway number

You walk in with institutional-grade analysis, market comps, complete confidence. You're not guessing. You're not stalling. You're not "checking with your team."

You're the most prepared person in the room. Every time.

That's what builds relationships. Not the analysis—the confidence and speed that come from having answers before they ask questions.

## 6. Reggie, why would I trust a 'digital version' of you when I don't even know you?

Don't trust me. Trust the 700+ transactions, the 51% WARI, the 235 passing tests, and the academic paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

This isn't gut feel in Python form.

Every methodology is documented. Every assumption is transparent. Every output has a JSON audit trail.

You're not trusting a person. You're trusting a system proven in the wild, then stress-tested with 235+ edge cases.

If it breaks, you'll know exactly where and why. Try getting that from a human VP.
