# FAQ

## Reggie, why would we hire you to be a VP if we can just use a digital version of you for $20/month?

You wouldn't. You wouldn't hire me to be a VP of leasing or asset management. You don't need me for that. The digital version of me works. You'd hire me to build digital versions of your other VPs. That's where the value is…building out your digital management team.
