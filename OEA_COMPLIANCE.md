## 1. Statutory Framework

### Ontario Expropriations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26

The Ontario Expropriations Act (OEA) governs all expropriations in Ontario, establishing:
- Procedural requirements for taking land
- Compensation framework for affected owners
- Hearing and appeal processes
- Registration and notice requirements

**Official Sources:**
- [CanLII - Expropriations Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-e26/latest/rso-1990-c-e26.html)
- [Ontario e-Laws](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e26)

### Governing Principles

1. **Full Compensation**: The owner should be made whole - compensated for all losses arising from the taking
2. **No Betterment**: The owner should not profit from the expropriation beyond actual losses
3. **Objective Valuation**: Market value determined by willing buyer/willing seller standard
4. **Procedural Fairness**: Owners entitled to notice, inquiry, and hearing rights

---

## 2. Compensation Components

### Section 13 - Compensation Payable

**s.13(1)**: "Where land is expropriated, the expropriating authority shall pay the owner such compensation as is determined in accordance with this Act."

**s.13(2)**: Compensation shall be based upon:
| Component | Section | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Market Value | s.14 | Fair market value of land taken |
| Disturbance Damages | s.18(1) | Costs arising from relocation |
| Injurious Affection | s.18(2) | Damage to remaining land |
| Special Difficulties | s.13(2)(d) | Relocation hardship |
| Business Loss | s.19 | Business relocation losses |
| Interest | s.20 | Interest on compensation |

### Section 14 - Market Value

**s.14(1)**: "The market value of land expropriated is the amount that the land might be expected to realize if sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer."

**Key Provisions:**

| Subsection | Requirement | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| s.14(2) | Equivalent reinstatement for special purpose properties | Cost approach permitted |
| s.14(3) | No account of reluctance to sell | No premium for unwillingness |
| s.14(4)(a) | Ignore special use value to expropriating authority | Exclude special purchaser value |
| s.14(4)(b) | Ignore value increase/decrease from the scheme | "Pointe Gourde" principle |
| s.14(5) | Apply highest and best use analysis | HBU at valuation date |

### Section 18 - Disturbance Damages

**s.18(1)** - Damages for disturbance include:
- (a) Reasonable costs of equivalent land
- (b) Reasonable costs of equivalent buildings
- (c) Legal, survey, and other acquisition costs
- (d) Costs of moving furniture, equipment, stock
- (e) Business re-establishment costs

**Important**: Per *Horn v. Sunderland Corporation*, an owner cannot claim both:
- Market value based on highest and best use, AND
- Disturbance damages based on existing use

This prevents "double dipping" - compensation must be consistent.

### Section 18(2) - Injurious Affection (Where Land Taken)

**Definition**: Reduction in market value of remaining land caused by:
- The taking itself
- Construction of public works
- Use of public works

**Calculation**: Measured through the before/after method:
```
Injurious Affection = Market Value (Before) - Market Value (After) - Land Taken Value
```

### Section 21 - Injurious Affection (No Land Taken)

**Three-Part Test** (Antrim):
1. Damage results from action taken under statutory authority
2. Action would give rise to liability but for statutory authority
3. Damage results from construction (not use) of works

**Fourth Element** (Nuisance):
- Interference must be **substantial** (non-trivial)
- Interference must be **unreasonable** (balancing test)

### Section 19 - Business Loss

**s.19(1)**: Compensation for business loss resulting from relocation made necessary by expropriation.

**Timing**: Business losses "shall not be determined until the business has moved and been in operation for six months or until a three-year period has elapsed, whichever occurs first."

**s.19(2)**: Tribunal may include an amount not exceeding the value of the business if:
- Business cannot be relocated
- Goodwill is lost

### Section 20 - Interest

Interest accrues on compensation from:
- Date of expropriation (registration of plan)
- At prescribed rate
- Until payment made

---

## 4. Valuation Methodologies

### Before/After Method (Primary for Partial Takings)

**Formula:**
```
Total Compensation = Market Value (Before) - Market Value (After)

Components within this calculation:
├── Land Taken Value (contributory value)
├── Severance Damages (to remainder)
└── Injurious Affection (from construction/use)
```

**Advantages:**
- Prevents double counting
- Captures all impacts in single calculation
- Court-preferred method in Ontario

**Warning - Do NOT use Value Plus Damages (VPD) method:**
Per [AIC guidance](https://www.aicanada.ca/article/expropriation-and-the-partial-taking-appraisal/), "an appraiser is more prone to exaggerate both elements of compensation" with VPD. Courts have reversed awards where appraisers "comingled two mutually exclusive approaches."

### Contributory Value (Partial Takings)

When valuing the part taken from a larger parcel:

**Correct Approach:**
1. Value whole property (before)
2. Determine contributory value of part taken to whole
3. Value remainder (after)
4. Difference = Total compensation

**Incorrect Approach:**
- Valuing part taken as if it were a separate fee simple parcel
- This can result in over-compensation

### Highest and Best Use Analysis

Per s.14(5), market value must consider highest and best use:

**Four-Part Test:**
1. **Legally Permissible**: Zoning, regulations, restrictions
2. **Physically Possible**: Size, shape, topography, utilities
3. **Financially Feasible**: Market demand, development costs
4. **Maximally Productive**: Use that produces highest value

**Ignore the Scheme** (s.14(4)(b)):
- Exclude value changes caused by the development requiring expropriation
- Both increases AND decreases must be ignored
- "Pointe Gourde" principle

### Easement Valuation Methods

**1. Percentage of Fee Simple**
| Easement Type | Typical Range | Factors |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Utility (overhead) | 5-15% | Width, restrictions, location |
| Utility (underground) | 10-25% | Depth, access needs, surface impact |
| Transmission (500kV) | 15-35% | Corridor width, tower placement |
| Access easement | 20-40% | Exclusivity, interference level |

**2. Income Capitalization**
- Calculate lost income from easement restrictions
- Apply capitalization rate
- Best for agricultural or income-producing properties

**3. Before/After (Complex Impacts)**
- Value property before easement
- Value property after easement granted
- Difference = Easement compensation

### Cost Approach (Special Purpose Properties)

Per s.14(2), for properties with no market comparables:
- Church, school, specialized industrial
- Measure as "reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement"
- Includes land + improvements + relocation

## 5. Key Case Law

### Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation), 2013 SCC 13

**[Full Decision](https://www.canlii.org/t/fwdn1)**

**Facts**: Highway 417 construction eliminated direct access to truck stop. No land taken, but business effectively destroyed.

**Held**: Injurious affection claim allowed. SCC clarified the three-part test for s.21 claims (no land taken).

**Significance**:
- Nuisance element requires "substantial and unreasonable" interference
- Public utility does not automatically negate claim
- Balancing exercise considers multiple factors, not just public benefit vs. private harm

### Horn v. Sunderland Corporation, [1941] 2 KB 26

**Principle**: No "double dipping" - owner cannot claim:
- Market value on highest and best use, AND
- Disturbance damages based on existing use

**Application**: If HBU differs from existing use, must choose one basis for compensation. Embedded in s.13(2) of OEA.

### Edwards v. Minister of Transportation (1964)

**The Edwards Rule**: For partial takings, severance damages to remainder should be determined by considering the before and after value of the remaining property as a separate unit.

**Caution**: Not all Canadian jurisdictions follow this rule strictly.

### Dell Holdings Ltd. v. Toronto Area Transit Operating Authority

**[CanLII Reference](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onscdc/doc/1997/1997canlii942/1997canlii942.html)**

**Principle**: Established framework for injurious affection claims from transit construction.

### Down v. Ontario

**Facts**: Partial taking of 20.96 acres from 72.37 acre agricultural property.

**Held**: Tribunal applied four-step HBU test to determine use both before (Living Area) and after (Employment Area) taking.

**Significance**: HBU can change between before and after valuations.

## 6. CUSPAP Standards

### Canadian Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2024

**[Official CUSPAP 2024 PDF](https://www.aicanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/CUSPAP-2024.pdf)**

All appraisals by AIC members must comply with CUSPAP 2024 for assignments on or after January 1, 2024.

### Jurisdictional Exception

Per CUSPAP 3.6.1, when legislation conflicts with CUSPAP standards, the **Jurisdictional Exception** allows appraisers to prioritize relevant law.

**Trigger**: "Compliance would be contrary to law or public policy applicable to the assignment."

**Responsibility**: The appraiser (not client) determines whether exception applies.

**Disclosure**: Must disclose through extraordinary assumptions and limiting conditions.

### Three Major OEA vs. CUSPAP Conflicts

| CUSPAP Standard | OEA Requirement | Resolution |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Analyze anticipated improvements | s.14(4)(b): Ignore the scheme | OEA prevails - exclude scheme |
| Account for betterment | s.23: Offset only against injurious affection | OEA prevails - limited offset |
| Market value only | s.14(2): Equivalent reinstatement for special purpose | OEA prevails - cost approach permitted |

### Required Disclosures

When invoking jurisdictional exception, appraisal report must:
1. Identify the legislative requirement
2. Explain conflict with CUSPAP
3. State that OEA requirements take precedence
4. Document impact on valuation methodology

### AIC Guidance

**[CUSPAP and Ontario Expropriations Act](https://www.aicanada.ca/article/cuspap-ontario-expropriations-act-jurisdictional-exception/)**

Key points:
- Reconciliation requires knowledge of both CUSPAP and OEA
- Jurisdictional exception is mandatory, not optional
- Appraiser must document the exception in every applicable report
