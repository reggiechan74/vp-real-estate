## 💡 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### **Sensitivity Analysis: Pricing Adjustments to Achieve Rank #3**

### **RECOMMENDATION: HOLD OR INCREASE PRICING**

Your property is in the Top 3 - you have strong competitive positioning. Consider:
- **Hold current pricing** and maintain selectivity on tenant quality
- **Increase rent by $0.25-0.50/sf** if market velocity is strong
- **Minimize concessions** - offer standard TI only (no above-market incentives)
- **Favor landlord-friendly lease terms** (shorter free rent, higher deposits)

## 📖 METHODOLOGY

This analysis uses a **multi-criteria weighted ranking system** to objectively assess competitive position:

1. **Data Collection**: Extract property attributes from comparable evidence
2. **Variable Weighting**: Assign importance weights based on tenant priorities
3. **Independent Ranking**: Rank each variable 1 (best) to X (worst) across all properties
4. **Weighted Score Calculation**: Sum of (rank × weight) for all variables
5. **Final Re-Ranking**: Sort properties by weighted score (lower = better)

### **Weights Used in This Analysis**


| Variable | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Net Asking Rent | 16.4% |
| Parking Ratio | 13.4% |
| Tmi | 13.4% |
| Clear Height Ft | 10.4% |
| Distance Km | 10.4% |
| Area Difference | 10.4% |
| Pct Office Space | 9.0% |
| Class | 7.5% |
| Building Age Years | 6.0% |
| Rail Access | 3.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **100.0%** |


✅ **Weights sum to 100.0%** - calculation verified

**Lower weighted score = fewer negative rank points = better competitive position**

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

- Model excludes qualitative factors (landlord reputation, property management quality, amenities)
- Weights represent average tenant priorities; individual tenants may weight factors differently
- Asking rents may not reflect net effective rents after concessions
- Rankings are point-in-time snapshots; market conditions change

**Validation**: Always confirm model results with market intelligence from brokers and recent lease transactions.
