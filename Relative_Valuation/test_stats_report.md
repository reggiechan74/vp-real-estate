## 📖 METHODOLOGY

This analysis uses a **multi-criteria weighted ranking system** to objectively assess competitive position:

1. **Data Collection**: Extract property attributes from comparable evidence
2. **Variable Weighting**: Assign importance weights based on tenant priorities
3. **Independent Ranking**: Rank each variable 1 (best) to X (worst) across all properties
4. **Weighted Score Calculation**: Sum of (rank × weight) for all variables
5. **Final Re-Ranking**: Sort properties by weighted score (lower = better)

### **Weights Used in This Analysis**


| Variable | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Net Asking Rent | 13.9% |
| Parking Ratio | 11.4% |
| Tmi | 11.4% |
| Clear Height Ft | 8.9% |
| Distance Km | 8.9% |
| Area Difference | 8.9% |
| Pct Office Space | 7.6% |
| Class | 6.3% |
| Building Age Years | 5.1% |
| Shipping Doors Tl | 5.1% |
| Bay Depth Ft | 5.1% |
| Shipping Doors Di | 3.8% |
| Power Amps | 3.8% |
| **TOTAL** | **100.0%** |


✅ **Weights sum to 100.0%** - calculation verified

**Lower weighted score = fewer negative rank points = better competitive position**

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

- Model excludes qualitative factors (landlord reputation, property management quality, amenities)
- Weights represent average tenant priorities; individual tenants may weight factors differently
- Asking rents may not reflect net effective rents after concessions
- Rankings are point-in-time snapshots; market conditions change

**Validation**: Always confirm model results with market intelligence from brokers and recent lease transactions.
