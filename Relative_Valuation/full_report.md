- **Reduction**: $2.01/sf
- **New TMI**: $4.93/sf
- **Estimated New Rank**: #4
- **Estimated New Score**: 39.62

- **New Net Rent**: $8.07/sf
- **New TMI**: $5.94/sf

### **RECOMMENDATION: AGGRESSIVE PRICING REDUCTION OR REPOSITIONING**

You are ranked #15 - **SERIOUS COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE**. Consider:
- **Aggressive rent reduction**: $0.56/sf or more
- **Capital investment**: Address structural weaknesses (parking, clear height, building age)
- **Reposition**: Convert to alternative use (self-storage, last-mile delivery, etc.)
- **Exit strategy**: Sell to value-add investor or owner-user

Price reduction alone may not be sufficient to overcome structural disadvantages.

## 📖 METHODOLOGY

This analysis uses a **multi-criteria weighted ranking system** to objectively assess competitive position:

1. **Data Collection**: Extract 9 key variables from comparable evidence
2. **Variable Weighting**: Assign importance weights totaling 100% (Net Rent 16%, Parking 15%, TMI 14%, etc.)
3. **Independent Ranking**: Rank each variable 1 (best) to X (worst) across all properties
4. **Weighted Score Calculation**: Sum of (rank × weight) for all variables
5. **Final Re-Ranking**: Sort properties by weighted score (lower = better)

**Key Variables**:
- **Net Asking Rent** (16%) - Most critical factor
- **Parking Ratio** (15%) - Essential for industrial/suburban office
- **TMI** (14%) - Total occupancy cost driver
- **Clear Height, % Office, Distance, Year Built, Area Match** (8-10% each)
- **Class** (7%) - Quality tier

**Lower weighted score = fewer negative rank points = better competitive position**

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

- Model excludes qualitative factors (landlord reputation, property management quality, amenities)
- Weights represent average tenant priorities; individual tenants may weight factors differently
- Asking rents may not reflect net effective rents after concessions
- Rankings are point-in-time snapshots; market conditions change

**Validation**: Always confirm model results with market intelligence from brokers and recent lease transactions.
