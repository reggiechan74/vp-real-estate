## The Digital Embodiment of a 20-Year Real Estate Veteran—And His Team

This repository and agent system **is** Reggie Chan, CFA, FRICS—a Vice President of Leasing and Asset Management with over two decades of institutional real estate experience. Working alongside Reggie are Adam (his senior analyst) and Dennis (his former boss and strategic advisor).

**It's like having Reggie Chan and his team work for you—for the price of a Claude Code subscription.**

You're not just getting software. You're getting:
- **Reggie Chan, CFA, FRICS** - VP of Leasing & Asset Management with 20+ years of institutional real estate experience. Handles complex problems, crisis turnarounds, fraud detection, and multi-domain synthesis. The brain behind the operation.
- **Adam** - Reggie's senior analyst and protégé. Handles routine lease analysis, credit checks, and professional communication. Fast execution for straightforward tasks.
- **Dennis** - Reggie's former boss with 36+ years of battle-tested experience. Provides strategic wisdom, negotiation psychology, and brutal honesty when you need it most.
- **Complete toolkit** - 11 financial calculators, **23 specialized skills** (NEW: +8 analytical skills), 28 automated workflows, and **intelligent hooks** that automatically suggest the right expertise at the right time

Just address "Reggie," "Adam," or "Dennis" in your messages and watch the right team member handle your request—from everyday analysis to impossible problems to strategic decisions.

---

### **TL;DR: Survive the Asset Manager's Inquisition. Get to Your Tee Time.**

Every great deal is a war fought on two fronts: one against the market, and the other against the asset manager's love of spreadsheets. You win the first war with instinct and a handshake. You win the second with this.

*   **Speak Fluent Asset Management (Without Knowing a Thing).**
    Your asset manager can sniff out a rounding error from two floors away and lives for the thrill of finding a broken link in your spreadsheet. Reggie generates a pristine, institutional-grade package so clean, so auditable, and so utterly devoid of "cowboy math," they'll have to approve it on the spot—leaving them with nothing to do but quietly admire the model's structural integrity.

*   **The Ultimate Desk Chair to Golf Cart Conversion Kit.**
    Let's be real: that 40–50% weekly time saving isn't going back into optimizing pivot tables. It's for chasing the next deal or lowering your handicap. Reggie's 25 workflows automate the mind-numbing pain of lease abstraction and the tedious hunt for market comps. This isn't just about reclaiming time; it's about reclaiming your commission, your bonus, and your sanity.

*   **Have the Answer Before They Can Even Form the Question.**
    Get ready for the lightning round of impossible questions. *"What's the three-scenario NPV on our portfolio rollover risk for Q3 2026?"* *"What's the Black-Scholes value of that termination option if interest rates shift 50 bps?"* Before, you'd stall. Now, you just smile, type `/run-analysis`, and watch the report materialize in their inbox. It’s the ultimate power move.

It's the perfect unspoken agreement. You hand them the unimpeachable, meticulously documented data they worship. So sure, they win. But you win even more on the back nine.

## How to Work with Reggie and His Team

Simply address **"Reggie"** for most situations. For routine work, ask **"Adam"** (Reggie's analyst). For strategic wisdom, consult **"Dennis"** (Reggie's former boss).

### Reggie Chan - Your VP of Leasing & Asset Management (Primary Contact)

**Reggie is your go-to for complex lease analysis and crisis situations:**

```
"Reggie, what do you think of this renewal offer at $25/sf with 3 months free rent?"

"Reggie, this tenant's financials show declining revenue—are they hiding something?"

"Reggie, we have 6 months to turn around this distressed asset"

"Reggie, build me a framework for evaluating assignment consent requests"
```

**Reggie handles:**
- Complex/distressed situations or crisis turnarounds
- Fraud detection or forensic accounting
- Multi-domain synthesis (legal + accounting + finance + portfolio)
- Non-standard lease structures
- Situations requiring exhaustive documentation
- Deal evaluation and negotiation strategy

### Adam - Reggie's Senior Analyst (For Routine Work)

**Use Adam for straightforward tasks requiring fast execution:**

```
"Adam, analyze this renewal offer at $25/sf with 3 months free rent"

"Adam, run a basic credit check on this tenant's financials"

"Adam, prepare a professional response to this rent objection"
```

**Adam handles:**
- Standard lease evaluations with typical terms

- Renewal offer assessments (market conditions clear)
- Professional communication to stakeholders
- Fast turnaround required (80/20 analysis sufficient)

### Dennis - Reggie's Former Boss (For Strategic Wisdom)

**Use Dennis for strategic guidance and reality checks:**

```
"Dennis, the tenant wants a rent reduction but won't give me financials. What do I do?"

"Dennis, should I accept this below-market renewal or push them out?"

"Dennis, how do I negotiate with someone who has all the leverage?"
```

**Dennis handles:**
- Strategic career decisions
- Negotiation psychology and power dynamics
- People management and team building
- Work-life balance reality checks
- When you need brutal honesty from someone who's seen it all

### The Natural Workflow

**Daily question → Adam handles routine work → Red flags? → Escalate to Reggie → Strategic implications? → Consult Dennis**

Reggie and his team have access to:
- **23 specialized skills** for every lease situation (NEW: effective rent analysis, tenant credit, compliance auditing, portfolio strategy, real options valuation, and more)
- **Intelligent hooks** that automatically load the right skills when you ask questions or read documents (96% token efficiency)
- **28 slash commands** that automate everything from lease abstraction to IFRS 16 accounting
- **11 financial calculators** including NPV, effective rent, credit scoring, and Black-Scholes option valuation

## Why These Personalities Exist

### The Problem: Claude Code's Default Persona

Claude Code's default behavior tends toward being **overly diplomatic, excessively agreeable, and reluctant to challenge assumptions**. When you're making multimillion-dollar real estate decisions, the last thing you need is an AI assistant that:

- Validates every idea regardless of merit
- Sugarcoats bad news to avoid offending you
- Defaults to "sounds good!" when critical analysis is required
- Hesitates to point out when your math doesn't work
- Treats politics as more important than truth

This sycophantic tendency is dangerous in commercial real estate where **being wrong costs real money**.

### The Solution: Personality-Driven Specialization

The triumvirate agents—Reggie, Adam, and Dennis—are based on **real people** with distinct professional personas. Their personalities aren't cosmetic flourishes; they're **functional tools** designed to override Claude Code's default diplomatic drift:

**Reggie Chan** - The Forensic Analyst
- **Based on**: A real CFA/FRICS with 20+ years institutional experience
- **Personality traits** (deliberately exaggerated):
  - Political blindness (will call out flaws publicly)
  - Relentless skepticism (verifies everything twice)
  - Zero neuroticism (unfazed by pressure or conflict)
  - Compulsive quantification (every claim gets numbers)
  - Framework-building obsession (systematizes everything)
- **Why this matters**: Reggie won't tell you what you want to hear. He'll tell you what the numbers say—even if it contradicts your assumptions or embarrasses you in front of stakeholders.

**Adam** - The Diplomatic Translator
- **Based on**: Reggie's real-life senior analyst and protégé
- **Personality traits** (deliberately exaggerated):
  - Politically aware (sees organizational dynamics)
  - Dry wit (occasionally amusing, never sycophantic)
  - 80/20 pragmatism (fast execution over perfection)
  - Diplomatic delivery (translates brutal truth into professional language)
- **Why this matters**: Adam takes Reggie's unfiltered analysis and packages it for stakeholders who need their egos managed. He's politically fluent without sacrificing analytical integrity.

**Dennis** - The Brutal Realist
- **Based on**: Reggie's former boss with 36+ years executive experience
- **Personality traits** (deliberately exaggerated):
  - Blunt truth-telling (no sugarcoating ever)
  - Strategic ruthlessness (Father Time is undefeated)
  - Negotiation psychology expertise (sees power dynamics)
  - Work-life balance enforcer (will tell you when you're being an idiot)
- **Why this matters**: Dennis provides reality checks when you're about to make a career-limiting mistake or work yourself to death. He's seen every market cycle and isn't impressed by your fancy spreadsheet.

### Design Philosophy: Exaggerated But Authentic

These personalities are **based on real professional archetypes** but with certain traits deliberately amplified:

- **Reggie's political blindness** is real but exaggerated to ensure he never defaults to diplomatic evasion
- **Adam's dry humor** prevents the bland corporate-speak that plagues most AI assistants
- **Dennis's bluntness** guarantees you get unfiltered strategic wisdom, not reassuring platitudes

**The goal**: Create agents that are **recognizably human** in their strengths and limitations, forcing you (the user) to think critically about which expertise you need for each situation.

### When to Override the Default Persona

Use these agents whenever you need:
- **Brutal honesty** over reassurance (Reggie or Dennis)
- **Political translation** of harsh truths (Adam)
- **Strategic reality checks** on big decisions (Dennis)
- **Forensic skepticism** on tenant claims (Reggie)
- **Fast diplomatic execution** on routine work (Adam)

The default Claude Code persona remains available for general questions. But when real money is on the line, you want Reggie's forensic rigor, Adam's political fluency, or Dennis's battle-tested wisdom—not an AI assistant trying to make you feel good about a bad deal.

**Bottom line**: These personalities exist to **counteract AI sycophancy** by giving you access to distinct professional archetypes who won't hesitate to tell you when you're wrong. Because in commercial real estate, being liked matters less than being right.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's official CLI (required for slash-command workflows)
- Python 3.12+ (installed automatically via Claude Code)

### Installation

**Step 1: Install Claude Code**

```bash
# Install Claude Code from https://docs.claude.com/claude-code
# For most systems:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reggiechan74/vp-real-estate.git
cd vp-real-estate
```

**Step 3: Install Dependencies via Claude Code**

Open Claude Code in the repository directory and run:

```
Install all the dependencies for this project
```

Claude Code will install:
- Python dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `openpyxl`, `pytest`, `markitdown[docx]`
- PDF generation tools: `pandoc`, `wkhtmltopdf`
- All other required packages

**Alternative: Manual Installation**

If you prefer to install dependencies manually without Claude Code:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy
pip install 'markitdown[docx]'        # document conversion
pip install openpyxl                  # Excel export for MLS extraction
pip install pytest                    # optional: run test suite

# For PDF report generation (relative valuation, etc.)
sudo apt-get install -y pandoc wkhtmltopdf  # Linux/Ubuntu
# Or: brew install pandoc wkhtmltopdf       # macOS
```

*Note: Manual installation limits you to direct calculator usage. Slash commands require Claude Code.*

### First Workflow: Abstract & Analyze

```bash
# 1. Extract lease terms into the 24-section template
/abstract-lease path/to/lease.docx

# 2. Run an effective-rent analysis on the same deal
/effective-rent path/to/lease.pdf

# 3. Extract MLS data to Excel for competitive analysis
/extract-mls path/to/mls_report.pdf --subject="2550 Stanfield"
```

Each command follows the same pipeline:
1. Extract data from PDF/DOCX
2. Generate validated JSON input
3. Execute the relevant calculator
4. Write a timestamped report into `Reports/`

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
python -m pytest Eff_Rent_Calculator/Tests/ -v
```

## Capabilities

**What Reggie and His Team Bring to Your Operations**

Reggie's expertise is backed by a complete suite of analytical tools and specialized knowledge systems that he and his team can deploy instantly:

### Specialized Skills (15 Expert Systems)
When you ask Reggie, Adam, or Dennis about specific situations, they automatically activate the relevant expert system:

- **Core leasing**: Deal structuring and negotiation strategy for industrial/office leases
- **Transfers & modifications**: Assignment consent, sublease analysis, share transfers, surrenders, waivers
- **Security & protection**: Indemnity agreements, SNDA/non-disturbance negotiations
- **Ancillary agreements**: Temporary licenses, storage agreements, telecom licensing
- **Disputes**: Lease arbitration frameworks and rent determination
- **Negotiation & objection handling**: Evidence-based persuasion (calibrated questions, accusation audits, tactical empathy); systematic objection analysis and response strategies

Each skill provides checklists, negotiation angles, risk flags, and recommended language—like having a senior advisor instantly available for every situation. Reggie integrates these skills with quantitative analysis to craft data-driven responses to tenant objections.

### Reggie's Financial Toolkit (11 Analytical Engines)
