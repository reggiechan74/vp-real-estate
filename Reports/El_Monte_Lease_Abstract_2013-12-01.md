| **Year 3** | June 1, 2015 - May 31, 2016 (12 months) | $480,000 | $40,000 | Cannot calculate |
| **Year 4** | June 1, 2016 - May 31, 2017 (12 months) | $600,000 | $50,000 | Cannot calculate |

| **ESTIMATED TOTAL** | **$50,000+ unknown additional costs** | **Cannot calculate without more data** |

### Additional Financial Considerations

#### Construction/Improvement Costs
- **Amount**: Unknown - Exhibit B (plans and specifications) not provided
- **Responsibility**: 100% Tenant
- **Insurance During Construction**: 3x construction expenditure
- **All Risk**: Construction delays, cost overruns on Tenant

#### Environmental Remediation
- **Cost**: Unknown - no scope or estimate provided
- **Responsibility**: 100% Tenant
- **⚠️ Risk**: Could range from tens of thousands to millions depending on contamination

#### Late Payment Penalties
- **Late Fee**: 5% of monthly rent if not received by 10th
- **Example**: On $50,000 rent = $2,500 late fee

#### Default/Early Termination
- **Cancellation Option**: $300,000 + all amounts due
- **Purchase Option**: $3,000,000 fixed price

### Comparison: Rent vs. Purchase Option

**Total rent if lease runs full initial term**: $3,840,000
**Purchase option price**: $3,000,000

**Analysis**:
- After approximately Year 5 (around June 2018), cumulative rent paid approaches purchase price
- Given Tenant is paying for all improvements, remediation, and triple net expenses, purchase option becomes increasingly attractive over time
- This structure suggests intent may be for Tenant to eventually purchase the property

### Net Effective Rent Analysis

Assuming 6-month rent-free period:
- **Nominal Average Rent**: $53,333/month (over 72 paying months)
- **Effective Average Rent (amortizing free rent)**: $49,231/month (over full 78 months)
- **Rate per Sq. Ft.**: Cannot calculate - no square footage provided

## 23. KEY ISSUES & RISKS

### ⚠️ CRITICAL RED FLAGS

#### 1. **Related Party Transaction**
- **Issue**: Jay Hooper signed as both Manager of Landlord (Temple CB, LLC) and President of Tenant (Okra Energy, Inc.)
- **Risk**: Potential conflict of interest; questions arm's length nature of transaction
- **Impact**: Terms may not reflect market conditions; potential issues with lender or investor scrutiny

#### 2. **Both Parties Share Same Address**
- **Issue**: Landlord and Tenant both at 4350 Temple City Boulevard, El Monte, CA 91731 (the leased property)
- **Risk**: Suggests common control or related entities
- **Impact**: Questions independence of parties; potential for transaction to be recharacterized

#### 3. **Missing Legal Description (Exhibit A Blank)**
- **Issue**: Exhibit A providing legal description of property is completely blank
- **Risk**: Fundamental ambiguity about precisely what property is being leased
- **Impact**: Could render lease unenforceable; title insurance issues; difficulty with assignments or financing

#### 4. **Missing Plans and Specifications (Exhibit B Blank)**
- **Issue**: Exhibit B providing construction plans and specifications is completely blank
- **Risk**: No definition of what Tenant is obligated or permitted to construct
- **Impact**: Disputes over scope of work, compliance, completion standards

#### 5. **Error in Rent Schedule**
- **Issue**: Rent schedule jumps from "June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018: $60,000" to "June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020: $70,000" - missing June 2018-May 2019
- **Risk**: Ambiguity about rent for 12-month period
- **Impact**: Potential dispute over $60,000/month vs $70,000/month for that year

#### 6. **No Square Footage Specified**
- **Issue**: Lease does not specify rentable area of premises
- **Risk**: Cannot calculate rate per square foot; difficulty comparing to market; financing issues
- **Impact**: Challenges with subleasing, financing, property valuation

#### 7. **Environmental Remediation - Existing Contamination**
- **Issue**: Lease acknowledges "portion of Leased Premises requires environmental remediation" with Tenant responsible
- **Risk**: Unknown scope and cost of cleanup; potential liability exceeding tens or hundreds of thousands
- **Impact**: Major unknown cost; potential regulatory liability; Phase I/II not mentioned

    - **Option 3**: Exercise cancellation right ($300K + amounts due) if project not viable
    - Model cash flows and returns for each scenario

30. **Assignment/Sublease Market Analysis**
    - Despite absolute right to assign, evaluate market for warehouse + power generation facility
    - Identify potential assignees/sublessees
    - Use restrictions may limit market
    - Determine if improvements are general-purpose or special-purpose

## 24. NOTES & COMMENTS

### Overall Assessment

This is a **highly unusual industrial lease** with several red flags and unique characteristics that require careful analysis before proceeding:

**Primary Concerns:**
1. **Related party transaction** - same signatory for both landlord and tenant raises significant concerns about arm's length nature
2. **Missing critical information** - blank exhibits for legal description and construction plans are potentially fatal defects
3. **Environmental liability** - tenant accepting unknown remediation costs for existing contamination is extremely risky
4. **Rent schedule error** - missing year creates ambiguity and potential disputes

**Unique Structure:**
This appears to be structured as a **lease-to-own** transaction given:
- Tenant-funded construction and improvements
- Purchase option at $3,000,000 (total base rent over term is $3,840,000)
- Tenant-funded environmental remediation
- After ~5 years, rent paid approaches purchase price, making purchase attractive
- Related party relationship suggests possible intent to transfer property

**Economic Analysis:**
- 6-month rent-free period is valuable ($180,000+)
- Graduated rent is tenant-friendly for startup phase
- BUT: Triple net expenses, construction costs, and environmental remediation add substantial unknown costs
- Purchase option provides significant optionality and potential value
- Cannot fully evaluate economics without square footage and cost estimates

**Risk Profile:**
- **Environmental risk**: Potentially very high - unlimited remediation liability for existing conditions
- **Construction risk**: High - all costs and delays on tenant
- **Operating cost risk**: Medium-high - triple net with no caps, but single tenant controls property
- **Legal risk**: High - related party transaction, missing exhibits, rent schedule error
- **Market risk**: Unknown - no square footage to compare to market rates

### Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order):

**CRITICAL (Do Before Proceeding):**
1. Obtain legal description (Exhibit A)
2. Conduct Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
3. Clarify rent schedule for June 2018 - May 2019
4. Investigate and document nature of related party relationship
5. Obtain construction plans and cost estimate (Exhibit B)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
6. Determine square footage via ANSI/BOMA measurement
7. Obtain preliminary title report
8. Verify zoning for warehouse and power generation use
9. Develop comprehensive operating budget (taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance)
10. Negotiate cap or cost-sharing on environmental remediation

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
11. Market analysis for comparable industrial rents in El Monte
12. Evaluate purchase option price vs. market value
13. Property survey
14. Permitting analysis for power generation
15. Execute First Amendment correcting all defects

**ONGOING:**
16. Monitor financial performance relative to personal liability trigger
17. Track critical dates (renewal options, payment deadlines)
18. Evaluate purchase vs. lease decision as property value and market conditions evolve
19. Maintain compliance with all environmental regulations
20. Preserve assignment/sublease flexibility

### Suitability Assessment:

**This lease may be suitable for Tenant (Okra Energy, Inc.) IF:**
- Tenant has adequate capital for construction, remediation, and unknown expenses
- Tenant intends to eventually purchase property (lease-to-own structure)
- Tenant is sophisticated in environmental remediation and understands the risk
- Tenant's relationship with Landlord is documented and legitimate
- Tenant can obtain financing despite unusual structure
- Power generation business model is viable at this location

**This lease is HIGH RISK and may NOT be suitable IF:**
- Tenant cannot obtain Phase I ESA showing limited environmental issues
- Construction or remediation costs exceed business model projections
- Tenant lacks capital reserves for unknown expenses
- Related party relationship creates conflicts or regulatory issues
- Square footage or property characteristics don't support economics
- Tenant needs conventional lease for financing purposes

### Legal Review Strongly Recommended:
Given the complexity, unusual terms, related party nature, environmental issues, and missing critical information, **this lease should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel** before execution or performance. Particular expertise needed in:
- Commercial real estate
- Environmental law
- Corporate governance (related party transactions)
- Real estate finance
