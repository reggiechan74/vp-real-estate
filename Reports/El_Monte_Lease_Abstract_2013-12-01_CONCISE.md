## 23. KEY ISSUES & RISKS

### 🚨 Critical Red Flags (Top 5)

1. **Related Party Transaction**: Jay Hooper signed for both landlord and tenant; both share same address
2. **Missing Legal Description**: Exhibit A completely blank - lease may be unenforceable
3. **Environmental Liability**: Tenant responsible for existing contamination with no scope, cost estimate, or cap
4. **Rent Schedule Error**: June 2018-May 2019 period missing - ambiguous rent amount
5. **No Square Footage**: Cannot calculate rates, estimate costs, or compare to market

### ✅ Most Favorable Terms (Top 7)

1. **Purchase Option**: $3M fixed price anytime (doesn't increase; becomes attractive after ~5 years)
2. **Cancellation Right**: Exit for $300K + amounts due anytime
3. **Absolute Assignment Rights**: No landlord consent required (extremely unusual)
4. **6-Month Rent Free**: $180K+ value
5. **Graduated Rent**: Tenant-friendly ramp from $30K to $70K over 6 years
6. **Fixed Renewal Rate**: $100K/month for all renewal terms (no escalation)
7. **Low Security Deposit**: Only $20K (less than 1/3 of final monthly rent)

### ⚠️ Most Unfavorable Terms (Top 7)

1. **Environmental Remediation**: Unlimited liability for existing contamination (could be $100K-$1M+)
2. **Triple Net with No Caps**: 100% of all costs with no limitations or budgets
3. **All Construction Costs**: Tenant pays 100%; no TI allowance; 3x insurance requirement
4. **Minimal Landlord Obligations**: Only 12-month warranty; tenant responsible for all after year 1
5. **Insurance Proceeds**: Excess to landlord, deficiency to tenant (asymmetric risk)
6. **Tenant Pays Landlord's Insurance**: No control over coverage landlord selects
7. **Personal Liability Trigger**: If financials inaccurate, landlord may pierce corporate veil

### 📋 Top 10 Items Requiring Review

1. **Obtain legal description** (Exhibit A) - potentially fatal defect
2. **Phase I Environmental Assessment** - understand contamination scope and cost
3. **Clarify rent schedule** - missing year creates ambiguity
4. **Investigate related party relationship** - tax and governance implications
5. **Obtain construction plans** (Exhibit B) and cost estimates
6. **Determine square footage** - needed for all financial analysis
7. **Develop operating budget** - taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance
8. **Environmental remediation quotes** - negotiate cap or cost-sharing
9. **Compare to market rates** - evaluate if pricing is reasonable
10. **Evaluate purchase vs. lease economics** - model all three exit options

---

## Summary Assessment

**Structure**: Appears to be lease-to-own transaction (tenant-funded improvements + $3M purchase option where cumulative rent approaches purchase price after ~5 years)

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Related party transaction, missing critical information (legal description, square footage, construction plans), unlimited environmental liability, numerous defects requiring correction

**Recommendation**: Execute First Amendment to correct all defects before proceeding. Strongly recommend legal counsel review (commercial real estate, environmental, corporate governance expertise).
