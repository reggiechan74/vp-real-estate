# Lease Deal Analysis: Test Tenant 2 - Test Building

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-30
**Prepared Using:** Ponzi Rental Rate (PRR) Framework

---

## Executive Summary

Test Tenant 2 proposes a 10-year lease for 10,000 sf at Test Building with varied rent schedule ($14.50-18.00/sf over term). The deal includes substantial incentives totaling $66.93/sf ($669,300 total). The proposed Net Effective Rent of **$5.09/sf/year fails to meet the Fully Levered Breakeven threshold of $6.46/sf/year**, resulting in a cash flow shortfall of $1.37/sf/year. While the deal meets Interest-Only Levered Breakeven, it is **cash flow dilutive** and would require equity distributions to exceed rental income.

**Quick Decision:**
- **Proposed NER:** $5.09 /sf/year
- **Fully Levered Breakeven:** $6.46 /sf/year
- **Recommendation:** ⚠ **NEGOTIATE** - Deal is dilutive by $1.37/sf/year
- **Spread:** $(1.37) /sf/year **below** breakeven (13,700 annual shortfall)

**Key Issue:** Heavy incentive package ($66.93/sf) combined with mid-term rent decrease (Year 5: $14.50/sf) creates negative cash flow despite strong finish at $18.00/sf.

## Investment Assessment

### Net Present Value Analysis

| Metric | Value ($/sf) |
|--------|--------------|
| NPV of Net Rent | $99.30 |
| NPV of Costs | $(66.93) |
| **NPV of Lease Deal** | **$32.37** |

**Analysis:**
- Total rent PV of $993,000 ($99.30/sf)
- Less costs of $669,300 ($66.93/sf)
- **Net deal value: $323,700** ($32.37/sf)
- Costs consume **67% of rent NPV** - very high burden

### Effective Rent Metrics

| Metric | Lease Term Only | Including Fixturing |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Net Effective Rent (NER) | $5.09 /sf/year | $4.35 /sf/year |
| Gross Effective Rent (GER) | $20.71 /sf/year | $20.42 /sf/year |
| Effective Term | 6.36 years | 6.61 years |

**Analysis:**
- NER of $5.09/sf represents **68% discount** from average face rent ($15.90/sf)
- Including fixturing reduces NER to $4.35/sf (**73% discount**)
- Effective term of 6.36 years reflects heavy upfront cost burden

### Breakeven Analysis

| Threshold | Required NER ($/sf/year) | Proposed NER | Status | Spread |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Unlevered Breakeven | $7.02 | $5.09 | ✗ FAIL | $(1.93) |
| I/O Levered Breakeven | $5.04 | $5.09 | ✓ MET | $0.05 |
| **Fully Levered Breakeven** | **$6.46** | **$5.09** | **✗ FAIL** | **$(1.37)** |
| Unlevered w/ Capital Recovery | $7.85 | $5.09 | ✗ FAIL | $(2.76) |
| Fully Levered w/ Capital Recovery | $7.28 | $5.09 | ✗ FAIL | $(2.19) |

**Capital Recovery:**
- Sinking Fund Requirement: $0.82 /sf/year
- Building Depreciation Period: 18 years remaining
- Building allocation: 40% ($45.55/sf)

**Critical Findings:**
1. ✓ **Meets I/O Levered Breakeven** by narrow margin ($0.05/sf)
2. ✗ **Fails Fully Levered Breakeven** by $1.37/sf/year
3. ✗ **Fails all capital recovery thresholds** by $2.19-2.76/sf/year

## Investment Recommendation

### Cash Flow Analysis

**Proposed Deal NER:** $5.09 /sf/year

**Critical Comparison:**
- vs. Fully Levered Breakeven: **$(1.37)** below ($6.46 - $5.09)
- vs. Unlevered Breakeven: $(1.93) below
- vs. Capital Recovery Breakeven: $(2.19) to $(2.76) below

**Annual Cash Flow Impact:**
- Property requires: $6.46/sf × 10,000 sf = $64,600/year
- Deal generates (NER): $5.09/sf × 10,000 sf = $50,900/year
- **Annual shortfall: $13,700/year**
- **10-year cumulative shortfall: $137,000**

### Risk Assessment

**Cash Flow Impact:**
- **Dilutive** by $1.37/sf/year
- Annual cash **shortfall**: $13,700
- Over 10-year term: **$137,000 cumulative loss**
- Company pays $64,600/year in debt/dividends but only collects $50,900/year in rent

**Valuation Impact:**
- Average face rent ($15.90/sf) **may be below market** given heavy incentives needed
- Year 5 rent decrease ($14.50/sf) sets **negative precedent**
- Ending rent ($18.00/sf) is positive but doesn't offset early shortfall
- **Neutral to slightly negative** valuation impact

**Strategic Risks:**
1. **Ponzi structure**: Deal requires raising money from new investors to pay old investors
2. **Principal repayment burden**: $1.54/sf/year not covered by rental income
3. **Building depreciation**: No recovery mechanism for $0.82/sf/year sinking fund
4. **Tenant credit risk**: Heavy incentives suggest tenant may be weak or space is difficult to lease

**Positive Factors:**
1. Meets I/O Levered Breakeven (barely)
2. Strong rent growth in later years (ending at $18.00/sf)
3. Long 10-year term provides stability
4. Some cash flow better than vacancy

### Recommendation

**⚠ NEGOTIATE - DO NOT APPROVE AS PRESENTED**

This deal is **cash flow dilutive** and fails the critical Fully Levered Breakeven threshold. The property will generate negative cash flow of $13,700/year, requiring the REIT to pay out more in dividends and debt service than it collects in rent.

**Why This Deal Fails:**
1. **Excessive incentives** ($66.93/sf) consume 67% of rent NPV
2. **Mid-term rent decrease** (Year 5) creates cash flow gap
3. **Principal repayments** ($1.54/sf/year) not covered by NER
4. **No capital recovery** - building depreciation ignored

**Negotiation Targets:**

To achieve Fully Levered Breakeven NER of **$6.46/sf/year**, make these adjustments:

**Option 1: Increase Rent (Recommended)**
- Increase Years 1-5 rent from $14.50-15.50 to **$16.00-17.00/sf**
- Maintain Year 5 at $16.50/sf (no decrease)
- Keep Years 6-10 as proposed or higher
- **Impact:** Achieves target NER while preserving deal structure

**Option 2: Reduce Incentives**
- Reduce TI from $30/sf to **$20/sf** (save $100,000)
- Reduce landlord's work from $125K to **$75K** (save $50,000)
- Reduce free rent from 4 months to **2 months** (save ~$48,000)
- **Impact:** Reduces costs to ~$47/sf, achieves target NER

**Option 3: Combination Approach (Best)**
- Increase starting rent to **$15.50/sf** (+$1.00)
- Eliminate Year 5 decrease (keep at $16.50/sf)
- Reduce TI to **$25/sf** (-$5/sf)
- Reduce free rent to **3 months** (-1 month)
- **Impact:** Balanced approach, more likely to be accepted

**Minimum Acceptable Terms:**
- **Target NER:** $6.46/sf/year (Fully Levered Breakeven)
- **Alternative threshold:** $7.28/sf/year (with capital recovery)
- **Fallback:** If tenant cannot meet targets, consider shorter term (5-7 years) to reduce risk

**If Negotiations Fail:**
- **REJECT** - Do not proceed with deal as structured
- Better to keep space vacant and market aggressively than to lock in a 10-year dilutive deal
- Consider alternative uses or building improvements to command higher rent

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Impact of Key Variables on NER:**

| Variable Change | Impact on NER | New NER | Meets Breakeven? |
|----------------|---------------|---------|------------------|
| **Base Case** | - | $5.09/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| +$5/sf TI (reduce to $25/sf) | +$0.32/sf | $5.41/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| +$10/sf TI (reduce to $20/sf) | +$0.65/sf | $5.74/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| -1 month free rent (3 months) | +$0.16/sf | $5.25/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| -2 months free rent (2 months) | +$0.31/sf | $5.40/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| +$1/sf rent (all years) | +$1.00/sf | $6.09/sf | ✗ FAIL (close) |
| +$2/sf rent (all years) | +$2.00/sf | $7.09/sf | ✓ MET |
| Eliminate Year 5 decrease | +$0.20/sf | $5.29/sf | ✗ FAIL |
| **Combination:** +$1.50 rent, -$5 TI, -1mo free | +$1.98/sf | $7.07/sf | ✓ MET |

**Key Findings:**
- Rent increases have the largest impact on NER
- A **$2/sf increase across all years** achieves breakeven
- **Combined adjustments** (rent + incentive reduction) most effective
- Eliminating Year 5 decrease alone is insufficient

## Appendices

### A. Calculation Methodology

This analysis uses the **Ponzi Rental Rate (PRR)** framework:

Chan, R. (2015). "Understanding the Ponzi Rental Rate: The Challenges with Using Net Effective Rents to Analyze Prospective Lease Deals within Real Estate Investment Trusts." *Real Estate Finance*, Vol. 32, No. 2, pp. 48-61.

**Key Principles:**
- All cash flows discounted at **10% annually** (monthly compounding)
- NER calculated as **annuity due** of NPV (payments at beginning of period)
- Breakeven rates based on actual **debt/equity servicing requirements**:
  - Dividends to unit holders: $3.17/sf/year (6.75% yield)
  - Interest on mortgage: $2.68/sf/year (4.01% rate)
  - Principal repayments: $1.54/sf/year (25-year amortization)
- Capital recovery via **Inwood sinking fund method** (FV accumulation)

**Why This Deal Fails the PRR Test:**

The proposed NER ($5.09/sf) only covers:
- ✓ Dividend payments ($3.17/sf)
- ✓ Interest payments ($2.68/sf) - **barely**
- ✗ Principal repayments ($1.54/sf) - **NOT COVERED**
- ✗ Building depreciation ($0.82/sf) - **IGNORED**

**Cash Flow Reality:**
- Cash IN: $5.09/sf/year (rental income)
- Cash OUT: $7.40/sf/year (dividends + debt service)
- **Shortfall: $2.31/sf/year must come from somewhere**

This is the definition of a **Ponzi structure** - the company must raise money from new investors (equity or debt) to pay existing investors (dividends and mortgage payments).

### B. Assumptions & Limitations

**Assumptions Made:**

1. **Property Investment Parameters:**
   - Acquisition cost: $6,104,553 ($104.03/sf of GLA)
   - Going-in LTV: 51.18% (standard REIT leverage)
   - Mortgage amortization: 300 months (25 years)
   - Building allocation: 40% of purchase price
   - Remaining building life: 18 years

2. **Financial Assumptions:**
   - Discount rate: 10% (standard for REITs)
   - Dividend yield: 6.75% (market rate for equity)
   - Interest cost: 3.02% (mortgage rate)
   - Principal payment rate: 2.67%/year

3. **Operational Assumptions:**
   - Operating costs fully recoverable ($14.14/sf)
   - No operating cost shortfalls
   - No non-recoverable capital expenditures during term
   - Tenant remains in occupancy for full 10-year term

**Data Sources:**
- Lease terms: `baf_input_test2.json`
- Investment parameters: Embedded in JSON file
- Market assumptions: Standard REIT metrics

**Limitations:**

1. **Analysis assumes tenant performs** - no credit analysis or bankruptcy risk assessment
2. **Market rent not validated** - no comparison to competing buildings or market surveys
3. **Renewal probability not assessed** - assumes lease ends after 10 years
4. **No sensitivity to interest rate changes** - assumes rates remain stable
5. **Building condition not evaluated** - depreciation schedule is theoretical
6. **Alternative uses not considered** - may be better uses for the space

**Critical Data Gaps:**
- Tenant creditworthiness/financial statements
- Comparable market rents
- Building age and condition
- Historical occupancy and rent levels
- Competitive market analysis
