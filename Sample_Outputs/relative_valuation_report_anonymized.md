## 💡 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### **Sensitivity Analysis: Pricing Adjustments to Achieve Rank #3**

### **RECOMMENDATION: HOLD OR INCREASE PRICING**

Your property is in the Top 3 - you have strong competitive positioning. Consider:
- **Hold current pricing** and maintain selectivity on tenant quality
- **Increase rent by $0.25-0.50/sf** if market velocity is strong
- **Minimize concessions** - offer standard TI only (no above-market incentives)
- **Favor landlord-friendly lease terms** (shorter free rent, higher deposits)

---

## 📖 METHODOLOGY

This analysis uses a **multi-criteria weighted ranking system** to objectively assess competitive position:

1. **Data Collection**: Extract 9 key variables from comparable evidence
2. **Variable Weighting**: Assign importance weights totaling 100% (Net Rent 16%, Parking 15%, TMI 14%, etc.)
3. **Independent Ranking**: Rank each variable 1 (best) to X (worst) across all properties
4. **Weighted Score Calculation**: Sum of (rank × weight) for all variables
5. **Final Re-Ranking**: Sort properties by weighted score (lower = better)

**Key Variables**:
- **Net Asking Rent** (16%) - Most critical factor
- **Parking Ratio** (15%) - Essential for industrial/suburban office
- **TMI** (14%) - Total occupancy cost driver
- **Clear Height, % Office, Distance, Year Built, Area Match** (8-10% each)
- **Class** (7%) - Quality tier

**Lower weighted score = fewer negative rank points = better competitive position**

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

- Model excludes qualitative factors (landlord reputation, property management quality, amenities)
- Weights represent average tenant priorities; individual tenants may weight factors differently
- Asking rents may not reflect net effective rents after concessions
- Rankings are point-in-time snapshots; market conditions change

**Validation**: Always confirm model results with market intelligence from brokers and recent lease transactions.
