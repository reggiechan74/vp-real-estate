## Score-to-Price Mapping

### Interpolation Method

The subject's composite score (11.594) falls between two bracketing comparables:

| Bracket | Property | Score | $/SF |
|---------|----------|-------|------|
| Lower (Better) | 3121 Universal Drive | 11.500 | $200.00 |
| **Subject** | **321 Humberline Drive** | **11.594** | **?** |
| Upper (Worse) | 5915 Wallace Street | 11.844 | $234.01 |

**Interpolation Calculation:**
- Position factor: (11.594 - 11.500) / (11.844 - 11.500) = 27.3%
- Interpolated Value: $200.00 + (27.3% × ($234.01 - $200.00)) = **$209.28/SF**

**Interpolation Confidence:** High (subject well-bracketed by comparables)

### Regression Method

**Model:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
**Equation:** Price/SF = α + β × (Composite Score)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Intercept (α) | $264.07/SF |
| Slope (β) | -$4.47/SF per score point |
| R² | 0.096 (9.6% variance explained) |
| Subject Score | 11.594 |

**Regression-Indicated Value:**
$264.07 + (-$4.47 × 11.594) = **$212.31/SF**

**Regression Notes:**
- Low R² indicates weak linear relationship between score and price
- This is common with MCDA as ordinal rankings capture relative position, not magnitude
- Interpolation is weighted higher when R² < 0.20

### Reconciliation

| Method | Weight | Indicated $/SF | Contribution |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Interpolation | 57% | $209.28 | $119.29 |
| Regression | 43% | $212.31 | $91.29 |
| **Reconciled** | **100%** | **$210.58** | **$210.58** |

**Weighting Rationale:** Subject is well-bracketed by comparables with similar characteristics. Interpolation receives higher weight due to strong bracketing position and weak regression fit (R² = 0.096).

## Value Indication

### Final Value Conclusion

| Metric | Per SF | Total |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Indicated Value** | **$210.58** | **$5,755,892** |
| Lower Range (-5.6%) | $198.81 | $5,468,097 |
| Upper Range (+5.9%) | $222.93 | $6,043,686 |

### Time Adjustment Consideration

**Important:** The comparable sales date from 2018-2020, representing a 6-8 year time gap from the January 15, 2026 valuation date.

| Adjustment Factor | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Annual Appreciation Rate | 5.0% |
| Average Time Gap | ~6.5 years |
| Implied Time Adjustment | ~32.5% |

**Prospective Adjusted Value (with time adjustment):**

If we apply the 5% annual appreciation rate to bring historical sales to current market levels:

| Metric | Unadjusted | Time-Adjusted (+32.5%) |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Indicated Value/SF | $210.58 | $279.02 |
| Total Indicated Value | $5,755,892 | $7,626,557 |
| Value Range | $5.47M - $6.04M | $7.25M - $8.01M |

**Recommended Value Range:** $7,250,000 - $8,010,000 (time-adjusted)

## Weight Profile: Industrial Default

The following weights were applied to rank properties:

| Variable | Weight | Direction | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Location Score | 20% | Higher is better | Primary value driver |
| Clear Height | 15% | Higher is better | Functional utility for racking/storage |
| Condition | 15% | Lower is better | Physical depreciation |
| Effective Age | 15% | Lower is better | Economic life remaining |
| Loading Docks | 10% | Higher is better | Operational efficiency |
| Highway Frontage | 10% | Yes is better | Visibility and access |
| Lot Size | 5% | Higher is better | Land value component |
| Building Size | 5% | Closer to subject | Comparability |
| Office Finish % | 5% | Higher is better | Value-added buildout |

## Methodology Notes

### MCDA vs Traditional Dollar Adjustment

| Aspect | Traditional DCA | MCDA Ordinal |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Adjustment Basis | Dollar amounts per unit | Relative rankings |
| Data Requirements | Paired sales for rates | Property characteristics |
| Sensitivity | Order-dependent | Order-independent |
| Transparency | May obscure uncertainty | Rankings visible |
| Heterogeneous Comps | Compounds errors | More robust |

### Ranking Methodology

1. **Ordinal Ranking:** Properties ranked 1-21 on each variable
2. **Tie Handling:** Average rank assigned to tied properties
3. **Weight Application:** Ranks weighted by variable importance
4. **Composite Score:** Sum of weighted ranks (lower = better property)

### Limitations

1. **Time Gap:** 6-8 year gap between sales and valuation date requires significant time adjustment
2. **Ordinal Limitation:** Rankings capture relative position, not magnitude of differences
3. **Missing Data:** Some comparables lack clear height data (defaulted to 18')
4. **Weak Regression Fit:** R² of 0.096 indicates score-price relationship is non-linear
