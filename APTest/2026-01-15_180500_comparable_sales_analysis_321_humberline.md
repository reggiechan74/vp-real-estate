## Reconciliation and Value Conclusion

### Adjusted Sale Price Reconciliation

| Comp | Address | Adjusted Price | $/SF | Gross Adj % | Net Adj % | Raw Weight | Normalized Weight | Weighted Value |
|------|---------|----------------|------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 255 Carrier Dr | $5,366,150 | $196 | 26.8% | -8.3% | 0.923 | 22.3% | $1,196,651 |

| | | | | | | **4.147** | **100.0%** | **$5,726,041** |

**Weight Formula:** Raw Weight = 1 / (1 + |Net Adj %| / 100)

### Statistical Analysis

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Weighted Average** | $5,726,041 |
| **Simple Average** | $5,313,653 |
| **Median** | $5,366,150 |
| **Standard Deviation** | $543,287 |
| **Coefficient of Variation** | 10.2% |
| **Range** | $4,687,800 - $6,122,440 |
| **Spread** | 30.6% |

**Reliability Assessment:** CV of 10.2% indicates **good consistency** among comparables after adjustments.

### Weighting Rationale

**Comparable #2 (190 Norseman): 24.0% Weight - HIGHEST**
- Smallest net adjustment (+0.4%) indicates best similarity to subject
- Same E1 zoning, similar industrial character
- VTB financing properly adjusted

**Comparable #1 (255 Carrier): 22.3% Weight**
- Moderate net adjustment (-8.3%)
- Similar building size and character
- Excellent condition vs. subject's average requires adjustment

**Comparable #5 (70 Galaxy): 21.8% Weight**
- Net adjustment (-10.5%) reflects significant office ratio difference
- Best time adjustment (most recent sale)
- Airport-adjacent location premium adjusted

**Comparable #3 (55 Brydon): 20.1% Weight**
- Larger net adjustment (+20.2%) due to smaller building size
- Oldest sale requiring significant time adjustment
- Good vintage comparability (1966 vs. 1978)

**Comparable #4 (105 Brockhouse): 19.1% Weight - LOWEST**
- Largest net adjustment (+26.5%)
- Highway frontage premium to comparable
- VTB financing and age adjustments

### Value Conclusion

Based on the foregoing analysis and weighted reconciliation of five comparable industrial sales in Etobicoke:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Indicated Value (Weighted Average)** | $5,726,041 |
| **Rounded** | **$5,750,000** |
| **Price per Square Foot** | **$210/SF** |
| **Price per Acre** | **$3,382,353/acre** |

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- All comparables within same municipality (Etobicoke)
- Consistent E1 zoning across all sales
- CV of 10.2% shows good consistency
- All gross adjustments 25-40% (CAUTION range) due to property age and time adjustments
- Subject's rail spur provides unique value not found in comparables

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Key Adjustment Sensitivity (±10% variation)

| Parameter | Base Rate | -10% | Base | +10% | Value Impact |
|-----------|-----------|------|------|------|--------------|
| Time Appreciation | 5.0%/yr | $5,649,000 | $5,750,000 | $5,851,000 | ±$100,000 (±1.7%) |
| Clear Height ($/SF/ft) | $2.00 | $5,675,000 | $5,750,000 | $5,825,000 | ±$75,000 (±1.3%) |
| Rail Spur Premium | 3.0% | $5,700,000 | $5,750,000 | $5,800,000 | ±$50,000 (±0.9%) |
| Office Finish ($/SF) | $15.00 | $5,725,000 | $5,750,000 | $5,775,000 | ±$25,000 (±0.4%) |

**Conclusion:** Value is most sensitive to time appreciation rate, followed by clear height adjustment. The 5%/year appreciation rate is supported by GTA industrial market data for 2018-2020.

---

## Market Context

### GTA Industrial Market (2018-2020)

The comparable sales analyzed span May 2018 to November 2019, a period of strong industrial demand in the Greater Toronto Area:

- **Vacancy Rate:** Sub-2% across GTA industrial markets
- **Rental Growth:** 6-8% annual increases in net asking rents
- **Sale Price Growth:** ~5% annual appreciation (conservative estimate)
- **Cap Rate Compression:** Industrial cap rates declined from ~6.0% to ~5.5%

The subject property's valuation date of February 1, 2020 represents the peak of the pre-pandemic industrial market, just before COVID-19 impacts.

### Etobicoke Industrial Submarket

- Established industrial area with limited new supply
- Proximity to Pearson International Airport (8 km)
- Access to Highway 401/427 interchange
- Mix of older (1960s-1980s) and newer industrial buildings
- E1 zoning permits broad industrial uses
- Rail access via CN industrial spur (subject property advantage)

---

## Compliance and Limitations

### Standards Compliance

**USPAP 2024:**
- Standards Rule 1-4(a): Comparable sales properly analyzed and adjusted
- Standards Rule 1-4(b): Adjustments supported by market evidence
- Standards Rule 2-2(a)(viii): Adjustment methodology disclosed

**CUSPAP 2024:**
- Section 4.2.3: Sales comparison approach properly applied
- Section 4.2.4: Adjustments quantified and supported
- Rules 6.2.15-6.2.17: Non-market-derived adjustments disclosed

### Assumptions

1. Subject property sold in fee simple, unencumbered except for CN rail easement
2. Market appreciation rate of 5%/year applied uniformly (supported by GTA industrial data)
3. Subject building in average condition as described in MPAC report
4. No hidden defects or environmental contamination beyond disclosed status
5. CN rail easement (EB387062) does not materially impair property value

### Limiting Conditions

1. This analysis is subject to satisfactory title and zoning compliance
2. No physical inspection of subject property performed (relied on MPAC report and photos)
3. No Phase I ESA or structural engineering report reviewed
4. Market conditions subject to change; value conclusion as of February 1, 2020 only
5. Adjustment rates derived from comparable sales analysis and professional judgment

### Extraordinary Assumptions

1. The CN rail easement provides positive value (rail spur access) rather than encumbrance
2. The subject property's manufacturing equipment (CAD-TEK) is not included in valuation
3. Property taxes and operating expenses are typical for the area
