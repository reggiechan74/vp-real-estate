### Statistical Analysis

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Weighted Average** | $5,444,970 |
| **Simple Average** | $5,840,282 |
| **Median** | $5,665,015 |
| **Standard Deviation** | $878,124 |
| **Coefficient of Variation** | 15.0% |
| **Range** | $4,976,832 - $7,054,267 |

### Weighting Rationale

**Comparable #1 (255 Carrier): 27.4% Weight - HIGHEST**
- Smallest absolute net adjustment (-4.5%)
- Good data quality; similar building size
- Passes all validation thresholds

**Comparable #4 (105 Claireport): 26.9% Weight**
- Best data quality (all fields populated)
- Small net adjustment (+6.3%)
- Modern building (1990) with higher clear height provides upper bracket

**Comparable #2 (190 Norseman): 24.8% Weight**
- Moderate net adjustment (+15.6%)
- Clear height correction (14 ft) increases adjustment magnitude
- VTB financing properly adjusted
- Oldest building (1956) but good condition

**Comparable #3 (55 Brydon): 22.5% Weight - LOWEST**
- Largest net adjustment (+27.6%) due to:
  - 8-foot clear height deficit (12 ft vs 20 ft)
  - Smallest building in sample (16,415 SF)
- Provides lower bound of value range
- Clear height correction from 15 ft to 12 ft materially increased adjustments

### Value Conclusion

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Indicated Value (Weighted Average)** | $5,444,970 |
| **Rounded** | **$5,500,000** |
| **Price per Square Foot** | **$201/SF** |
| **Price per Acre** | **$3,235,294/acre** |

**Comparison to Prior Analysis:**

| Indicated Value | $5,750,000 | $5,500,000 | -$250,000 (-4.3%) |
| $/SF | $210/SF | $201/SF | -$9/SF |
| Comparables Used | 5 | 4 | -1 |

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM

Factors affecting confidence:
- (+) All 4 comparables from same municipality with E1 zoning
- (+) Two comparables pass all validation thresholds (gross < 25%)
- (+) Complete data for all critical adjustment fields
- (-) Two comparables in CAUTION range (gross 25-40%)
- (-) CV of 15.0% indicates moderate dispersion
- (-) Reduced sample size (4 vs 5 comparables)

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Impact of Clear Height Correction

The 55 Brydon Drive clear height correction from 15 ft to 12 ft had material impact:

| Parameter | Prior Value | Corrected Value | Adjustment Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Clear Height Differential | 5 ft | 8 ft | +$164,000 additional |
| Clear Height Adjustment | +$164,150 | +$437,344 | +$273,194 |
| Final Adjusted Price | $4,687,800 | $4,976,832 | +$289,032 |

Net effect on weighted value: Approximately -$75,000 to overall conclusion due to increased weighting distance from other comparables.

### Key Adjustment Sensitivity (±10% variation)

| Parameter | Base | -10% | +10% | Value Impact |
|-----------|------|------|------|--------------|
| Time Appreciation (5%/yr) | $5,500,000 | $5,425,000 | $5,575,000 | ±$75,000 |
| Clear Height ($2/SF/ft) | $5,500,000 | $5,440,000 | $5,560,000 | ±$60,000 |
| Rail Spur Premium (3%) | $5,500,000 | $5,475,000 | $5,525,000 | ±$25,000 |
