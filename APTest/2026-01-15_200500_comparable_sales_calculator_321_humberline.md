## Reconciliation

### Weighting Methodology

**Threshold-Based Quality Weighting:**

| Net Adjustment Range | Weight | Rationale |
|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| <5% | 2.0x | Minimal adjustments indicate high comparability |
| 5-10% | 1.5x | Small adjustments indicate good comparability |
| 10-25% | 1.0x | Moderate adjustments - standard weight |
| 25-40% gross | 0.5x | Caution range - reduced reliability |
| >40% gross | 0.0x | Rejected - insufficient comparability |

### Weight Assignment

| Comparable | Net Adj % | Weight | Weighted Value |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 255 Carrier Dr | -7.3% | 1.5x | $8,130,313 |
| 190 Norseman St | +6.0% | 1.5x | $9,696,247 |
| 55 Brydon Dr | +16.7% | 1.0x | $4,552,307 |
| 105 Claireport Cres | +10.8% | 1.0x | $5,984,699 |
| **Total** | | **5.0x** | **$28,363,566** |

**Reconciled Value:** $28,363,566 ÷ 5.0 = **$5,672,713**

## CUSPAP Compliance Disclosures

### Data Limitations (4)

1. **Single pair for condition** - Cannot validate statistically; corroborate with other methods
2. **Single pair for clear_height** - Cannot validate statistically; corroborate with other methods
3. **Single pair for loading_docks** - Cannot validate statistically; corroborate with other methods
4. **Insufficient submarket diversity** - Cannot derive market-based location adjustments

### Methodology Limitations (3)

1. **Size adjustment bounded** from -80.1% to -8.0% per 10,000 SF (derived value outside reasonable range)
2. **Clear height adjustment bounded** from -$3.18 to $0.50/ft/SF (constrained to $0.50-$4.00 based on cost approach)
3. **Loading dock value bounded** from -$112,500 to $15,000 per dock (constrained to $15,000-$75,000 based on cost approach)

### Non-Market Derived Adjustments (2)

1. **Highway frontage premium:** Using industry default of 12.0% (prior market extraction studies)
2. **Rail spur premium:** Using industry default of $350,000 (railway siding installation cost estimates)

## Comparison: Calculator vs. Manual Analysis

| Metric | Manual Analysis | Calculator | Difference |
|--------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Reconciled Value** | $5,500,000 | $5,672,713 | +$172,713 (+3.1%) |
| **$/SF** | $201 | $208 | +$7/SF |
| Weighting Method | Inverse net adjustment | Threshold-based | Different |
| Rail Spur Treatment | 3% fixed | 7% of value | Higher premium |
| Condition Adjustment | Manual estimates | 6.43%/level derived | Systematic |
| Clear Height Adjustment | $2/ft/SF manual | $0.50/ft/SF bounded | Lower rate |

### Value Difference Explanation

The $172,713 (3.1%) higher value from the calculator results from:

1. **Threshold-based weighting** - Comparables with <10% net adjustment receive 1.5x weight (vs. inverse weighting)
2. **Rail spur premium** - Calculated as 7% of time-adjusted property value (vs. 3% fixed)
3. **Condition adjustments** - Applied consistently at 6.43%/level from paired sales derivation
4. **Smaller clear height adjustments** - Bounded at $0.50/ft/SF (vs. $2.00/ft/SF manual)
