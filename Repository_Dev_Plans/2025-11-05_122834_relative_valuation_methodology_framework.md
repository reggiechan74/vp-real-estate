# RELATIVE VALUATION MODEL METHODOLOGY & FRAMEWORK

**Report Date**: November 5, 2025
**Analysis Type**: Competitive Market Positioning
**Methodology**: Multi-Criteria Weighted Ranking System
**Application**: Industrial & Office Commercial Real Estate

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The **Relative Valuation Model** is a systematic, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework that determines a subject property's **competitive position** within its market comparable set for the purpose of **winning lease transactions**.

Unlike traditional comparable analysis that focuses solely on property characteristics, this methodology answers the critical question: **"For the price we're asking, how likely are we to win the deal against competing properties?"**

### Key Finding from Sample Analysis

**Subject Property: Industrial Unit - Competitive Analysis**
- **Weighted Score**: 38.61
- **Market Ranking**: #7 out of 123 comparables
- **Strategic Implication**: **NOT COMPETITIVE** - 6 competing units offer superior value at their asking prices
- **Action Required**: Reduce asking rent or increase incentives to achieve Top 3 ranking

### Critical Interpretation

**Ranking Position = Deal-Winning Probability**

| Ranking | Competitive Status | Deal-Winning Probability | Action Required |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **#1** | **Market Leader** | 80-90% | Maintain pricing, maximize rent |
| **#2-3** | **Competitive** | 60-75% | Hold pricing, minor incentives |
| **#4-10** | **Marginally Competitive** | 30-50% | Price reduction or major incentives required |
| **#11-20** | **Weak Position** | 10-25% | Significant price reduction needed |
| **#21+** | **Not Competitive** | <10% | Major repositioning or exit strategy |

**Rule**: If you're not ranked #1, #2, or #3, you are **unlikely to win** against tenants who shop the market rationally.

## METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW

### **The Four-Step Framework**

```
Step 1: Data Collection (Extract Physical, Locational, Financial Attributes)
                ↓
Step 2: Variable Weighting (Assign Importance Weights Totaling 100%)
                ↓
Step 3: Independent Ranking (Rank Each Variable 1=Best to X=Worst)
                ↓
Step 4: Weighted Score Calculation & Re-Ranking (Final Competitive Position)
```

### **The Fundamental Equation**

```
Competitive Position = f(Physical Quality, Location, Price, Operating Costs)
                       subject to Market Context & Tenant Requirements

Where:
- Lower Weighted Score = Better Competitive Position
- Rank 1 = Maximum competitiveness (most likely to win deal)
- Rank X = Minimum competitiveness (unlikely to win deal)
```

---

## STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION

Extract from comparable evidence (CoStar, broker packages, market surveys) the following attributes for **each comparable unit** including the subject property:

### **Physical Attributes**

| Variable | Description | Impact on Competitiveness |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Year Built** | Construction year (proxy for age/quality) | Newer = better; affects finishes, systems, functionality |
| **Clear Height (ft)** | Interior ceiling height | Higher = better for industrial (racking, equipment); less critical for office |
| **% Office Space** | Percentage of total SF that is office | Higher for office users; lower for pure industrial/warehouse |
| **Available SF** | Square footage available for lease | Closer match to tenant requirement = better |
| **Difference in Area SF** | \|Subject SF - Comparable SF\| | Smaller difference = better match to tenant needs |
| **Total Building Area (sf)** | Total rentable area of building | Provides context (multi-tenant vs single) |
| **Class** | Building quality tier (A=1, B=2, C=3) | Lower number = higher quality = better |

### **Locational Attributes**

| Variable | Description | Impact on Competitiveness |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Distance from Subject (km)** | Distance between comparable and subject | Closer = more direct competition; farther = less substitutable |

**Note**: Subject property serves as geographic center; comparables are selected within market radius (typically 5-15 km for industrial, 3-10 km for office).

### **Financial Attributes**

| Variable | Description | Impact on Competitiveness |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Net Asking Rent ($/sf)** | Base rent before operating costs | Lower = better (more affordable) |
| **TMI ($/sf)** | Taxes, Maintenance, Insurance (operating costs) | Lower = better (reduces total occupancy cost) |
| **Gross Asking Rent ($/sf)** | Net Rent + TMI | Total rent burden on tenant |
| **Gross Dollar Rent / Year** | Annual rent (Gross Rent × SF) | Total cash outlay |
| **Parking Ratio** | Parking spaces per 1,000 sf | Higher = better (critical for industrial/suburban office) |

### **Market Context**

| Variable | Description | Impact on Competitiveness |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Vacancy Rate (%)** | % of building that is vacant | Higher vacancy = landlord may be more flexible on pricing |
| **Landlord** | Property owner/manager | Reputation, tenant relationships, deal flexibility |

---

## STEP 2: VARIABLE WEIGHTING

Assign **importance weights** to the variables that drive tenant decision-making. Weights must sum to **100% (1.0)**.

### **Standard Weighting Schema (Industrial)**

Based on sample analysis (May 2020):

| Rank | Variable | Weight | Rationale |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Net Asking Rent** | **16%** | **Primary driver** - absolute price competitiveness |
| 2 | **Parking Ratio** | **15%** | Critical for industrial/suburban office; insufficient parking = deal killer |
| 3 | **TMI (Operating Costs)** | **14%** | **Total occupancy cost** = Net Rent + TMI; affects affordability |
| 4 | **Year Built** | **8%** | Age/quality proxy; affects systems, layout, aesthetics |
| 5 | **Clear Height** | **10%** | Essential for industrial (racking, equipment); less for office |
| 6 | **% Office Space** | **10%** | Product type match; varies by tenant (3PL vs office user) |
| 7 | **Distance from Subject** | **10%** | Location desirability; proximity to labor, customers, transit |
| 8 | **Difference in Area SF** | **10%** | Size match; tenant has specific space needs |
| 9 | **Class** | **7%** | Quality tier; captured indirectly by other factors (age, rent, finishes) |
| | **TOTAL** | **100%** | |

**Key Insight**: **Net Rent (16%) + TMI (14%) = 30%** of total weighting → **Price/Cost is the dominant factor** in winning deals.

### **Adjusting Weights by Property Type**

Weights should be **calibrated to tenant priorities** for each property type:

#### **Industrial/Warehouse**
```
Net Rent:        16%
Parking:         15%  ← High (trucks, employee parking)
TMI:             14%
Clear Height:    12%  ← High (racking, equipment)
% Office:         8%  ← Low (pure warehouse users)
Distance:        12%  ← High (logistics, freight)
Area Difference: 10%
Year Built:       8%
Class:            5%
```

#### **Office**
```
Net Rent:        18%  ← Higher (price-sensitive)
Parking:         12%  ← Moderate (suburban) or Low (urban)
TMI:             15%
Clear Height:     5%  ← Low (less critical)
% Office:        15%  ← High (office configuration important)
Distance:        12%  ← High (transit, amenities)
Area Difference: 10%
Year Built:       8%
Class:            5%
```

#### **Flex/R&D**
```
Net Rent:        15%
Parking:         15%
TMI:             12%
Clear Height:    10%
% Office:        12%  ← Balanced (mixed use)
Distance:        10%
Area Difference: 10%
Year Built:      10%
Class:            6%
```

---

## STEP 3: INDEPENDENT RANKING

For **each variable**, rank all properties (including subject) from **1 (best) to X (worst)** where X = total number of comparables.

### **Ranking Rules**

#### **Variables Where Lower Value = Better Rank (1)**

| Variable | Ranking Rule | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Net Asking Rent** | Lower rent = Rank 1 | $8.95/sf → Rank 5; $10.25/sf → Rank 25 |
| **TMI** | Lower TMI = Rank 1 | $4.17/sf → Rank 11; $7.17/sf → Rank 118 |
| **Distance from Subject** | Closer = Rank 1 | 1.1 km → Rank 3; 17.1 km → Rank 114 |
| **Difference in Area SF** | Smaller difference = Rank 1 | 187 sf → Rank 28; 2,576 sf → Rank 121 |
| **Class** | A=1 (Rank 1), B=2 (Rank 15), C=3 (Rank 72) | Class A → Rank 1-15; Class C → Rank 72+ |

#### **Variables Where Higher Value = Better Rank (1)**

| Variable | Ranking Rule | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Clear Height** | Higher ceiling = Rank 1 | 18.5 ft → Rank 15; 10.6 ft → Rank 122 |
| **Parking Ratio** | More parking = Rank 1 | 3.05 spaces/1k → Rank 3; 0.48 spaces/1k → Rank 121 |
| **% Office Space** | Depends on tenant need | Office user: 100% office → Rank 1; Warehouse user: 0% office → Rank 1 |
| **Year Built** | Newer construction (higher year) = Rank 1 | 1990 → Rank 20; 1974 → Rank 95 |

**Implementation Tip**: Use a descending rank (RANK.EQ with `order = 0`) or convert Year Built to property age so newer assets receive better ranks consistently.

```

---

## STEP 4: WEIGHTED SCORE CALCULATION & RE-RANKING

### **Weighted Score Formula**

For each property, calculate:

```
Weighted Score = Σ (Individual Variable Rank × Variable Weight)

                = (Year Built Rank        × 0.08)
                + (Clear Height Rank      × 0.10)
                + (% Office Rank          × 0.10)
                + (Parking Rank           × 0.15)
                + (Distance Rank          × 0.10)
                + (Net Asking Rent Rank   × 0.16)
                + (TMI Rank               × 0.14)
                + (Class Rank             × 0.07)
                + (Area Difference Rank   × 0.10)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Lower Weighted Score = Better Competitive Position**
- Weighted Score represents the "total negative rank points" accumulated
- Properties with fewer negative points (lower score) are more competitive

### **Example Calculation: 1575 Trinity Dr**

```
Weighted Score = (54 × 0.08) + (44 × 0.10) + (73 × 0.10) + (3 × 0.15)
                + (44 × 0.10) + (7 × 0.16) + (59 × 0.14) + (15 × 0.07)
                + (68 × 0.10)

               = 4.32 + 4.40 + 7.30 + 0.45 + 4.40 + 1.12 + 8.26 + 1.05 + 6.80

               = 38.10
```

**Why is this score low (good)?**
- **Parking Rank = 3** (excellent) weighted at 15% → contributes only 0.45 points
- **Net Rent Rank = 7** (good) weighted at 16% → contributes only 1.12 points
- These two factors (31% total weight) are both excellent, driving low total score

### **Re-Ranking All Properties by Weighted Score**

Sort all properties by weighted score (ascending):

| Final Rank | Property | Weighted Score | Key Competitive Advantages |
|------------|----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **#1** | 5484 Tomken Rd, Unit 24 | **34.18** | **MARKET LEADER** - Best overall value proposition |
| **#2** | 2179 Dunwin Drive, Unit 3 | **36.09** | Strong across multiple factors |
| **#3** | 2500 Meadowpine Blvd, Unit 6 | **36.31** | Competitive pricing + location |
| #4 | 5315 Tomken Rd, Unit 5 | 37.59 | Low TMI, excellent distance |
| #5 | 980 Pacific Gate, Unit 21 | 37.79 | Balanced profile |
| #6 | 1575 Trinity Dr, Unit 6 | 38.10 | Excellent parking (Rank 3), low rent (Rank 7) |
| **#7** | **SUBJECT PROPERTY** | **38.61** | **MARGINALLY COMPETITIVE** |
| #8 | 5100 Maingate Dr, Unit 1-2 | 38.99 | |
| ... | ... | ... | |
| #112 | 2709 Rena Rd | 70.85 | Poor on most dimensions |

---

## STRATEGIC INTERPRETATION

### **What Does Ranking #7 Mean?**

**Critical Reality**: **The subject property is NOT competitive at its current asking price.**

#### **Value Proposition Comparison**

```
Rank #1 (Score 34.18):  "Best value in the market - tenant saves money AND gets quality"
Rank #2 (Score 36.09):  "Second-best value - strong alternative to #1"
Rank #3 (Score 36.31):  "Third-best value - competitive, will win some deals"
  ↓
  ↓ [Competitive Threshold - Top 3 win ~80% of deals]
  ↓
Rank #7 (Score 38.61):  "6 properties offer better value - tenant has no reason to choose us"
```

#### **Tenant Decision-Making Logic**

**Rational Tenant Behavior**:
1. Tenant tours 8-12 properties
2. Creates shortlist of 3-5 properties
3. Negotiates with top 2-3 properties offering best value
4. Selects property ranked #1 or #2 in their internal analysis

**If Subject is Ranked #7**:
- Tenant's analysis shows 6 better alternatives
- Subject is eliminated in shortlist phase
- Subject never gets to final negotiation
- **Deal probability: 10-20%** (only wins if tenant has unique requirement subject meets)

### **Why Being #7 is Problematic**

#### **The "Winner's Curse" Paradox**

| Scenario | Outcome | Landlord Position |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Subject **WINS** deal at Rank #7 | Landlord likely **overpaid on incentives** or tenant had unique constraint | Pyrrhic victory - profitability compromised |
| Subject **LOSES** deal at Rank #7 | Expected outcome - 6 better alternatives existed | Wasted marketing/showing time |

**Key Insight**: **Winning a deal when ranked #7+ usually means you left money on the table through excessive concessions.**

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING FRAMEWORK

### **Ranking Tiers & Strategic Actions**

#### **TIER 1: MARKET LEADERS (Rank #1-3)**

**Competitive Status**: **HIGHLY COMPETITIVE**
**Deal-Winning Probability**: **70-90%**
**Market Share**: These 3 properties will capture ~75% of tenant activity

**Strategic Actions**:
1. **Pricing**: Hold asking rent or increase by $0.25-0.50/sf
2. **Incentives**: Minimize - offer standard market TI only
3. **Lease Terms**: Favor landlord terms (shorter free rent, higher deposits, stricter assignment clauses)
4. **Tenant Selection**: Be selective - choose creditworthy, long-term tenants
5. **Marketing**: Emphasize competitive advantages in top-weighted factors

**Sample: Rank #1 (Score 34.18)**
```
Action Plan:
- Increase net rent from $X to $X + $0.50/sf
- Reduce TI allowance from $10/sf to $7/sf
- Offer only 1 month free rent (vs market 2 months)
- Target investment-grade tenants only
- Expected lease-up: 30-60 days
```

---

#### **TIER 2: COMPETITIVE (Rank #4-10)**

**Competitive Status**: **MARGINALLY COMPETITIVE**
**Deal-Winning Probability**: **30-50%**
**Market Share**: These properties will capture ~20% of tenant activity

**Strategic Actions**:
1. **Pricing**: **REDUCE** net rent by $0.25-0.75/sf to move into Top 3
2. **Incentives**: Offer **above-market** TI allowance (+$2-5/sf) OR additional free rent
3. **Lease Terms**: Flexible - match or beat Top 3 lease structures
4. **Tenant Selection**: Broaden criteria - consider B+/B credit quality
5. **Marketing**: Identify and emphasize differentiating factors not captured in model

**Sample: Rank #7 (Score 38.61) - SUBJECT PROPERTY**
```
Current Asking: $9.50/sf net + $5.50/sf TMI = $15.00/sf gross

Gap Analysis:
- Rank #3 (Score 36.31): $9.00/sf net + $5.25/sf TMI = $14.25/sf gross
- Difference: $0.75/sf gross rent disadvantage

Option 1: REDUCE NET RENT
- New Ask: $8.75/sf net (reduce by $0.75/sf)
- Recalculate rankings → likely moves to Rank #3-4

Option 2: INCREASE INCENTIVES
- Hold rent at $9.50/sf
- Offer $12/sf TI (vs market $8/sf) = $4/sf advantage
- Offer 3 months free rent (vs market 2 months)
- Amortized over 5-year term = $0.80/sf effective rent reduction

Option 3: HYBRID
- Reduce net rent by $0.25/sf to $9.25/sf
- Offer $10/sf TI (vs market $8/sf)
- Offer 2.5 months free rent

RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 (Price Reduction)
- Most transparent to market
- Improves rank to Top 3
- Higher probability of lease-up success
```

---

#### **TIER 3: WEAK POSITION (Rank #11-20)**

**Competitive Status**: **NOT COMPETITIVE**
**Deal-Winning Probability**: **10-25%**
**Market Share**: These properties will capture ~5% of tenant activity (distressed/constrained tenants only)

**Strategic Actions**:
1. **Pricing**: **AGGRESSIVE REDUCTION** - drop net rent by $1.00-2.00/sf
2. **Incentives**: **Maximum concessions** - high TI, 4-6 months free rent, tenant improvement allowances
3. **Lease Terms**: Very flexible - short-term options, expansion rights, low/no deposits
4. **Tenant Selection**: Accept C+ credit - focus on lease velocity over tenant quality
5. **Capital Investment**: Consider property improvements to address ranking weaknesses
   - If Clear Height rank is poor → Can't fix
   - If Parking rank is poor → Add parking spaces
   - If Building Age rank is poor → Renovate common areas, upgrade HVAC/electrical

**Sample: Rank #11 (Score 42.34)**
```
Problem: Terrible parking (Rank 121) + large size mismatch (Rank 121)

Option 1: MAJOR PRICE REDUCTION
- Reduce net rent by $1.50/sf
- Expected move to Rank #5-7

Option 2: CAPITAL INVESTMENT
- Add 15 parking spaces (cost: $50k)
- Improves Parking Rank from 121 → 30
- Recalculate: Expected move to Rank #6-8
- Payback period: 2-3 years

Option 3: SUBDIVIDE SPACE
- Split 4,776 sf unit into two 2,388 sf units
- Reduces "Difference in Area" rank from 121 → 20-30
- Expected ranking improvement to #8-10
```

---

#### **TIER 4: NOT COMPETITIVE (Rank #21+)**

**Competitive Status**: **FUNDAMENTALLY UNCOMPETITIVE**
**Deal-Winning Probability**: **<10%**
**Market Share**: Minimal - only captures tenants with unique constraints

**Strategic Actions**:
1. **Pricing**: Price reduction alone won't solve - structural issues exist
2. **Repositioning**: Consider alternative uses:
   - Convert office to creative/maker space
   - Convert industrial to self-storage or last-mile delivery
   - Sell to user (owner-occupied)
3. **Redevelopment**: Demolish and rebuild (if land value > building value)
4. **Exit Strategy**: Sell to value-add investor at discount
5. **Accept Long Vacancy**: Hold for market recovery if fundamentals improve

**Sample: Rank #69 (Score 59.18)**
```
Problems:
- High TMI (Rank 117) → $6.94/sf vs market $4.50/sf
- Far distance (Rank 99) → 13.4 km vs market center
- Low office % (Rank 96) → 15% in office-oriented market

Analysis:
Even if net rent drops to $0/sf, high TMI keeps gross rent at $6.94/sf.
Distance and product type mismatch are structural impediments.

RECOMMENDATION: EXIT STRATEGY
- List for sale as value-add opportunity
- Target buyer: User or investor willing to reposition
- Expected sale price: $120/sf (vs market $180/sf)
```

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### **Rent Reduction Scenarios: Moving from Rank #7 to Top 3**

Assuming Subject Property current metrics:
- Current Net Rent: $9.50/sf
- Current TMI: $5.50/sf
- Current Gross Rent: $15.00/sf
- Current Rank: #7 (Weighted Score: 38.61)

**Objective**: Achieve Rank #2 or #3 (Weighted Scores: 36.09 - 36.31)

#### **Scenario 1: Net Rent Reduction Only**

| Net Rent Reduction | New Net Rent | New Gross Rent | Estimated New Rank | New Weighted Score |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| -$0.25/sf | $9.25/sf | $14.75/sf | #6 | 37.85 |
| -$0.50/sf | $9.00/sf | $14.50/sf | #4-5 | 37.01 |
| -$0.75/sf | $8.75/sf | $14.25/sf | **#3** | **36.31** |
| -$1.00/sf | $8.50/sf | $14.00/sf | **#2** | **35.47** |

**Net Rent is weighted at 16%**, so:
- Moving from Rank 30 → Rank 20 in Net Rent = improvement of 10 ranks
- Weighted impact: 10 × 0.16 = 1.6 points reduction in Weighted Score

**Calculation**:
- To move from Score 38.61 → 36.31 = need 2.3 point reduction
- Net Rent rank improvement needed: 2.3 ÷ 0.16 = 14.4 ranks
- Estimated rent reduction: 14.4 ranks × ~$0.05/rank = **$0.72/sf reduction**

**RECOMMENDATION: Reduce net rent by $0.75/sf to achieve Rank #3**

#### **Scenario 2: TMI Reduction (Negotiate with Property Manager)**

| TMI Reduction | New TMI | New Gross Rent | Estimated New Rank | New Weighted Score |
|---------------|---------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| -$0.25/sf | $5.25/sf | $14.75/sf | #6 | 37.85 |
| -$0.50/sf | $5.00/sf | $14.50/sf | #5 | 37.09 |
| -$0.75/sf | $4.75/sf | $14.25/sf | **#3-4** | **36.47** |

**TMI is weighted at 14%**, so:
- Similar impact to net rent, slightly less leverage

**Method**: Negotiate with property manager to reduce management fees, optimize utilities, contest property tax assessment.

#### **Scenario 3: TI Allowance Increase (Effective Rent Reduction)**

| TI Allowance Increase | Amortized $/sf/yr (5-year term) | Effective Net Rent | Estimated New Rank |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| +$2/sf | -$0.40/sf/yr | $9.10/sf | #6 |
| +$5/sf | -$1.00/sf/yr | $8.50/sf | #4-5 |
| +$8/sf | -$1.60/sf/yr | $7.90/sf | **#2-3** |

**Note**: TI allowance is a **one-time cost** amortized over lease term. More expensive than rent reduction but less transparent to market (doesn't affect asking rent on listings).

#### **Scenario 4: Free Rent Increase**

| Free Rent Period | Effective Rent Reduction (5-yr term) | Effective Net Rent | Estimated New Rank |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 month | -$0.16/sf/yr | $9.34/sf | #7 (no change) |
| 2 months (market) | -$0.32/sf/yr | $9.18/sf | #6 |
| 3 months | -$0.48/sf/yr | $9.02/sf | #5 |
| 4 months | -$0.63/sf/yr | $8.87/sf | #4 |
| 6 months | -$0.95/sf/yr | $8.55/sf | **#3** |

**Note**: Free rent is less valuable to landlord than rent reduction (delays cash flow) but equivalent to tenant on NPV basis.

## DYNAMIC WEIGHTING: TENANT-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

The standard weighting schema (16% Net Rent, 15% Parking, etc.) represents **average tenant priorities**. For specific tenant types, weights should be adjusted.

### **Example: 3PL / Logistics Tenant**

**Tenant Profile**: Third-party logistics company, 24/7 operations, truck access critical

**Adjusted Weights**:
```
Clear Height:       18%  ← UP from 10% (need 28-32 ft for racking)
Parking Ratio:      18%  ← UP from 15% (employee + truck parking)
Net Rent:           14%  ← DOWN from 16% (less price-sensitive if functionality met)
Distance:           12%  ← UP from 10% (proximity to highways/customers)
TMI:                12%  ← DOWN from 14%
Truck Doors:        12%  ← NEW VARIABLE (drive-in doors essential)
% Office:            5%  ← DOWN from 10% (minimal office needs)
Year Built:          5%  ← DOWN from 8%
Area Difference:     4%
```

**Impact on Subject Ranking**:
- If subject has excellent clear height (28 ft) and truck access but moderate rent
- Under standard weights: Rank #7
- Under 3PL-adjusted weights: Rank #2-3

**Application**: Run separate ranking for each tenant inquiry based on their stated priorities.

### **Example: Professional Services Office Tenant**

**Tenant Profile**: Law firm, accounting firm, consulting - image-conscious, client-facing

**Adjusted Weights**:
```
Class (Building Quality): 15%  ← UP from 7% (brand/image critical)
% Office Space:           15%  ← UP from 10% (need full office layout)
Distance (to transit):    14%  ← UP from 10% (employee commute)
Net Rent:                 14%  ← DOWN from 16% (less price-sensitive)
TMI:                      12%  ← DOWN from 14%
Parking:                  10%  ← DOWN from 15% (if urban/transit-oriented)
Year Built:               10%  ← UP from 8% (appearance matters)
Clear Height:              5%  ← DOWN from 10% (not relevant)
Area Difference:           5%
```

## ADVANCED MODEL ENHANCEMENTS

### **Outcome-Based Calibration Loop**

- Capture actual leasing outcomes (won/lost, achieved net rent, incentives granted) alongside the historical weighted scores.  
- Quarterly, run a logistic regression or gradient boosting model to measure how each attribute correlates with wins; convert the resulting coefficients into refreshed weights.  
- Apply a stability guardrail (e.g., ±3 percentage points per quarter) so sudden market noise does not over-rotate the framework.  
- Store all calibration runs in the workbook’s `Calibration` tab to maintain an audit trail and make reversions straightforward if results diverge from on-the-ground intel.

### **Non-Linear Scoring Options**

- Introduce piecewise score curves where marginal improvements near the market median matter more than tail-end differences (e.g., apply heavier penalties once net rent exceeds the 75th percentile).  
- Alternatively, standardize each variable (z-scores) before ranking to control for skewed distributions such as distance or parking ratios.  
- Document the chosen transformation directly in the workbook so analysts know which formula (linear rank vs adjusted score) they are using on each tab.

### **Qualitative Override Layer**

- Add an override panel that captures reputation, amenity fit, landlord flexibility, and deal certainty on a 1–5 scale.  
- Limit the override contribution to 10–15% of the total score so qualitative advantages can influence—but not overwhelm—the quantitative foundation.  
- Require a short justification note for each override entry to keep the process auditable.

### **Tenant Persona Questionnaire**

- Build a short intake form (e.g., data validation dropdowns in Excel or a Google Form) that asks leasing teams about operating hours, parking demand, ceiling/door requirements, image sensitivity, and incentive appetite.  
- Map responses to pre-defined weight packs (Industrial Core, 3PL, Office Urban, Office Suburban, Flex/R&D) and auto-populate the weight table—removing the need for manual edits to individual percentages.  
- Snapshot the selected persona in the analysis output so stakeholders understand which tenant profile drove the rankings.

### **Tenant-Focused Gross Effective Rent**

- Maintain the base rent + TMI baseline to align with MLS data availability; most listings omit TI allowances or free rent details.  
- When incentives are disclosed or negotiated, add optional input fields for tenant improvement allowances, free rent periods, and step-ups. Calculate gross effective rent from the tenant’s perspective (exclude commissions and landlord transaction costs).  
- Flag properties missing incentive data so analysts know the effective rent comparison reverts to the base/TMI estimate. This keeps the model transparent while encouraging richer data capture where possible.

## CLAUDE AGENT IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

The end-state deliverable is a Python-based implementation that powers a Claude code agent companion skill. Use this report as the functional specification for that build:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**  
   - Create parsers for CoStar/broker spreadsheets and MLS exports (CSV/XLSX).  
   - Normalize schema to the attribute list in Step 1 and persist comparisons in a lightweight store (e.g., SQLite or DuckDB).  
   - Capture provenance and timestamps so the agent can explain where each data point originated.

2. **Core Scoring Engine**  
   - Implement rank calculations, weight application, and weighted-score aggregation as modular Python functions.  
   - Support both linear ranks and optional non-linear transforms (piecewise or z-score) via configuration flags.  
   - Expose the qualitative override logic as a post-processing hook with guardrails (max 15% weight effect).

3. **Tenant Persona Module**  
   - Encode persona questionnaires as structured prompts or JSON schemas.  
   - Map responses to the predefined weight packs and feed them into the scoring engine automatically.  
   - Surface the selected persona and weight set in the agent’s rationale messages for transparency.

4. **Calibration + Outcomes Feedback**  
   - Store historical deal outcomes and rerun logistic/boosted models on demand to refresh weights.  
   - Version the resulting coefficients so the agent can revert if new weights underperform.  
   - Provide summary diagnostics (AUC, lift charts) so users can judge reliability.

5. **Effective Rent Extension**  
   - Keep base rent + TMI as required fields; treat TI/free rent fields as optional with explicit null handling.  
   - When incentives are present, calculate tenant-facing gross effective rent and include it in the competitive summary narrative.  
   - Log incentive data availability so the agent can report confidence levels in the price comparison.

6. **Agent UX + Governance**  
   - Structure outputs as markdown tables and narrative blocks mirroring this report so human reviewers get consistent insights.  
   - Enforce audit logging (inputs, weights used, overrides applied, calibration version) for every agent run.  
   - Provide guardrails that require human confirmation before publishing recommendations with large price moves (e.g., >$1.00/sf net change).

This roadmap ensures the methodology transitions cleanly from documentation to an operational Claude skill while retaining transparency and control.

## PORTFOLIO APPLICATION

### **Running Relative Valuation Across Multiple Assets**

For landlords with **portfolio of properties**, run this analysis for each vacant unit:

#### **Portfolio Ranking Summary**

| Property | Unit | Current Rank | Weighted Score | Status | Recommended Action |
|----------|------|--------------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| 5484 Tomken Rd | 24 | **#1** | 34.18 | HOLD | Increase rent $0.50/sf, maximize terms |
| 2179 Dunwin Dr | 3 | **#2** | 36.09 | HOLD | Maintain current pricing |
| 2500 Meadowpine | 6 | **#3** | 36.31 | HOLD | Maintain current pricing |
| 5315 Tomken Rd | 5 | #4 | 37.59 | MONITOR | Minor incentive if no activity in 60 days |
| 980 Pacific Gate | 21 | #5 | 37.79 | MONITOR | Minor incentive if no activity in 60 days |
| 1575 Trinity Dr | 6 | #6 | 38.10 | REDUCE | Drop rent $0.50/sf |
| **SUBJECT** | **TBD** | **#7** | **38.61** | **REDUCE** | **Drop rent $0.75/sf or offer $8/sf TI** |
| 5100 Maingate Dr | 1-2 | #8 | 38.99 | REDUCE | Drop rent $0.75/sf |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2709 Rena Rd | - | #112 | 70.85 | EXIT | List for sale |

**Portfolio Strategy**:
1. **Focus leasing efforts on Top 10 ranked units** - 80% of deals will come from these
2. **Price aggressively on units ranked #11-30** - move to Top 10 or accept vacancy
3. **Consider disposition for units ranked #50+** - structural disadvantages unlikely to resolve

---

## LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS

### **Model Limitations**

1. **Quantifiable Factors Only**: Model excludes qualitative factors:
   - Landlord reputation and tenant relationships
   - Property management quality and responsiveness
   - Lease flexibility and willingness to negotiate
   - Building amenities (fitness center, café, conference rooms)
   - Tenant mix and co-tenancy appeal

2. **Static Weights**: Weights are averages; individual tenant priorities vary significantly

3. **Market Context**: Model doesn't capture:
   - Market velocity (leasing activity level)
   - Landlord urgency (motivated sellers lease faster)
   - Tenant constraints (time pressure, relocation deadline)
   - Off-market information (upcoming vacancies, tenant expansions)

4. **Data Quality**: Rankings are only as good as comparable data:
   - Asking rents may not reflect net effective rents (after concessions)
   - Some comparables may be off-market or under LOI
   - Landlord flexibility varies (some negotiate 20%, others 5%)

5. **Linear Assumption**: Model assumes linear relationships (e.g., $0.50/sf rent reduction = 10 rank improvement) which may not hold across full range

### **When Model Breaks Down**

**Scenario 1: Unique Tenant Requirements**
- Tenant needs specific feature subject has (e.g., cold storage, hazmat permit, rail access)
- Model ranks subject #15, but tenant has no alternatives → subject wins at market rent

**Scenario 2: Motivated Landlord**
- Subject ranked #7, but Rank #1-6 properties have landlords unwilling to negotiate
- Subject landlord offers 20% discount → subject wins despite rank

**Scenario 3: Relationship-Driven Deals**
- Tenant CEO is personal friend of landlord
- Model irrelevant - deal done based on relationship

**Scenario 4: Build-to-Suit Alternative**
- Tenant can build-to-suit at $100/sf construction cost
- If rent reduction required exceeds build-to-suit economics, tenant builds instead

## WORKFLOW: IMPLEMENTING RELATIVE VALUATION

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

#### **Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1)**

1. **Define Market Area**:
   - Industrial: 10-15 km radius from subject
   - Office: 5-10 km radius (3-5 km for urban CBD)
   - Flex/R&D: 8-12 km radius

2. **Identify Comparables**:
   - Use CoStar, LoopNet, Crexi, or broker packages
   - Filter criteria:
     - Size: Within 50% of subject (if subject is 2,000 sf, include 1,000-3,000 sf)
     - Property type: Same (industrial, office, flex)
     - Available now or within 90 days
     - Actively marketed (not under LOI)

3. **Extract Data**:
   - Use PDF extraction tools or manual entry
   - Collect all 17 physical/financial variables for each comparable
   - Verify data with listing brokers where possible

4. **Subject Property Data**:
   - Use same measurement standards (ANSI/BOMA)
   - Calculate distance from subject to each comparable (Google Maps API)
   - Document all assumptions (e.g., "Assumed Class B based on age and finishes")

#### **Phase 2: Weighting & Ranking (Week 2)**

1. **Calibrate Weights**:
   - Start with standard schema (16% Net Rent, 15% Parking, etc.)
   - Adjust based on property type and local market
   - Route leasing teams through the tenant persona questionnaire; auto-populate the workbook with the corresponding weight pack
   - Validate with leasing team: "Do these weights match tenant priorities we see?"

2. **Rank Variables**:
   - Use Excel RANK() function for each variable column
   - Handle ties: Use RANK.AVG() to average tied ranks
   - Validate: Highest rank number should equal number of comparables

3. **Calculate Weighted Scores**:
   - Formula: `=SUMPRODUCT(rank_range, weight_range)`
   - Validate: Scores should range from ~20 (best) to ~80+ (worst) for 100+ comparables
   - Where curated, experiment with non-linear score sheets (piecewise price penalties, z-score normalization) and document which variant is in use

4. **Re-Rank by Weighted Score**:
   - Sort all properties by Weighted Score (ascending)
   - Assign Final Rank 1 to X
   - Apply qualitative overrides only after baseline scores are finalized; capture override notes for audit

#### **Phase 3: Analysis & Recommendations (Week 2-3)**

1. **Identify Subject's Competitive Position**:
   - Note subject's Final Rank
   - Calculate gap to Rank #3 (Score #3 - Subject Score = gap points)

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Run Scenario 1: Net rent reduction to close gap
   - Run Scenario 2: TMI reduction
   - Run Scenario 3: TI allowance increase
   - Run Scenario 4: Free rent increase

3. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - If Rank #1-3: Hold or increase pricing
   - If Rank #4-10: Reduce pricing by $X/sf or offer $Y/sf TI
   - If Rank #11-20: Aggressive pricing reduction or capital improvement
   - If Rank #21+: Reposition or exit
   - Document any qualitative override rationale and ensure recommended actions reflect those qualitative insights

4. **Validate with Market Intelligence**:
   - Check recent lease transactions: Do lower-ranked properties lease slower?
   - Confirm with brokers: Are our weights/rankings consistent with their deal flow?
   - Test: Run analysis on recently leased comparable - did winner have top rank?
   - Log the outcome in the calibration dataset (win/loss, achieved rent, incentive amounts) to support the next weight refresh

#### **Phase 4: Execution & Monitoring (Ongoing)**

1. **Implement Pricing Changes**:
   - Update listings on CoStar, LoopNet, broker packages
   - Communicate new pricing to leasing team and brokers
   - Document rationale in internal memo

2. **Track Results**:
   - Measure tour activity (tours per week before vs after price change)
   - Measure LOI activity (days to first LOI)
   - Measure lease velocity (days from price change to lease execution)
   - Record actual incentives granted so effective rent calculations stay current even when MLS data is silent

3. **Update Model Quarterly**:
   - Remove leased comparables
   - Add new availabilities
   - Re-calculate rankings
   - Run the calibration loop to refresh weights and publish the new coefficients
   - Adjust subject pricing if rank changes materially

## CONCLUSION

The **Relative Valuation Model** transforms subjective lease pricing decisions into a **systematic, data-driven framework** for competitive positioning.

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Ranking = Probability of Winning Deal**
   - Rank #1-3: High probability (70-90%)
   - Rank #4-10: Moderate probability (30-50%) - **action required**
   - Rank #11+: Low probability (<25%) - **major intervention required**

2. **Price is Dominant but Not Sole Factor**
   - Net Rent + TMI = 30% of weighting
   - Physical/locational factors = 70% of weighting
   - **Cannot compensate for structural disadvantages with price alone**

3. **Objectivity Creates Accountability**
   - Removes emotion and bias from pricing decisions
   - Creates audit trail for future analysis
   - Enables portfolio-level optimization

4. **Continuous Improvement Through Validation**
   - Compare model predictions to actual lease outcomes
   - Refine weights based on empirical deal flow
   - Adjust for market-specific tenant priorities
   - Feed results into the calibration dataset so refreshed coefficients stay grounded in evidence

5. **Operational Enhancements Drive Adoption**
   - Persona-driven weight packs and qualitative override notes align the model with how leasing teams work day-to-day
   - Optional effective rent inputs keep tenant-facing economics visible even when MLS data is limited to base rent + TMI

### **Next Steps for Subject Property**

**Current Position**: Rank #7 with Weighted Score 38.61
**Objective**: Achieve Rank #2-3 to maximize deal-winning probability
**Gap to Close**: 38.61 - 36.31 = **2.30 points**

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Reduce net asking rent by $0.75/sf** → Expected move to Rank #3
2. **OR offer $8/sf TI allowance** (vs market $5/sf) → Expected move to Rank #4
3. **Monitor market for 60 days** → If no LOI activity, implement Option 1
4. **Re-run analysis monthly** → Adjust as comparables lease or new availabilities emerge
