# LinkedIn Introduction - VP Real Estate Toolkit (Short Version)

---

## From Spreadsheet Monk to Deal Closer

I was THAT guy who lived in Excel and crapped all over the leasing team when their math didn't add up. Good at models. Terrible at people.

**That was 2012.**

By 2020, our team went from six people to one. Me. Doing both asset management AND leasing AND a condo conversion project. Alone. 40 properties. 4 million SF. 100+ transactions in two years.

I had two choices: drown, or build systems that would scale me.

**I built systems.**

## The Results

**These tools achieved:**

- **51% weighted average rent increase** (2020) when market did 26%
- **700+ lease transactions** across 4 million square feet
- **141% industrial portfolio value growth** vs 35% market growth
- **VTS Rookie of the Year** + published academic research

Every calculator ran real deals. Every workflow closed real transactions. Every framework survived investment committee scrutiny.

**Nine years of institutional operations, digitized and open-sourced.  For you.**

## The Agentic Team

**I've digitized my former team and embedded their personalities as AI agents.**

**Reggie** - The VP who calls the CFO's numbers wrong. Politically blind but technically brilliant. Use for Mission:Impossibles.

**Adam** - Senior analyst trained in institutional rigor. Sees politics where Reggie's blind. Use for routine work.

**Dennis** - Former boss with 36+ years experience. Speaks softly but hits with a big stick. Use for big strategic decisions.

**Why it matters:** They counteract AI sycophancy. You get truth instead of validation.
