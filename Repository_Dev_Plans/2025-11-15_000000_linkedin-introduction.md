# LinkedIn Introduction - VP Real Estate Toolkit

## From Spreadsheet Monk to Deal Closer

I was the asset manager who lived in Excel and crapped all over the leasing team when their math didn't add up. Good at models. Terrible at people. Proud of the distinction.

**That was 2012.**

By 2020, our team went from six people to one. Me. Doing both asset management AND leasing. Alone.

**40 properties. 4 million SF. 100+ transactions in two years.**

I had two choices: drown, or build systems that would scale me.

I built systems.

## The Results

**These are the actual tools I used to achieve:**

- **51% weighted average rent increase** (2020) when market did 26%
- **700+ lease transactions** across 4 million square feet
- **141% industrial portfolio value growth** vs 35% market growth
- **VTS Rookie of the Year** while publishing academic research (Journal of Real Estate Finance, 2015)

Every calculator here ran real deals. Every workflow closed real transactions. Every framework survived investment committee meetings where the CFO asked hard questions and the math had to hold up.

**Nine years of institutional operations, digitized and open-sourced.**

## The Agentic Team

**I've digitized my former team and embedded their personalities as AI agents.**

Just address them by name—they respond instantly with their distinct expertise:

**Reggie** (the VP) - the guy who craps all over leasing people
- Forensic analyst who calls the CFO's numbers wrong. In front of everyone. Because they're wrong.
- Deep expertise in lease analysis, crisis management, fraud detection
- Politically blind but technically brilliant
- *Use when:* Complex problems, distressed situations, exhaustive analysis needed

**Adam** - Senior Analyst
- Reggie's protégé trained in institutional rigor with exceptional speed
- Sees politics where Reggie's blind, translates brutal truth into diplomatic delivery
- Fast 80/20 execution on day-to-day work
- *Use when:* Standard lease evaluations, routine credit checks, professional communication

**Dennis** - Strategic Advisor
- Reggie's former boss with 36+ years battle-tested experience
- Blunt strategic wisdom with no sugarcoating
- Negotiation psychology, people management, career decisions
- *Use when:* Big decisions with long-term consequences, tough love needed

**Why distinct personalities matter:** They counteract AI sycophancy. You get truth instead of validation. Because in commercial real estate, being liked by your AI assistant matters less than getting the deal right.
