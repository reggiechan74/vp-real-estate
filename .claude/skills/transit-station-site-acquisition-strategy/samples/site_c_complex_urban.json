    "description": "Highly desirable TOD location in historic ethnic neighborhood with excellent density, walkability, and transit connections. However, significant acquisition complexity with 18+ property owners, substantial residential and business displacement in a low-income community with strong cultural ties. High gentrification risk and significant community opposition. Critical holdout risk from sophisticated commercial property owners."
