2. Landlord reviews and conducts due diligence
3. Landlord responds (consent, conditional consent, or refusal)
4. Parties negotiate terms of consent agreement
5. Consent agreement executed by all three parties
6. Share transfer closes
7. Tenant notifies landlord of completion

## Practical Guidance & Best Practices

4. **Operating Costs**: Review 3 years of operating cost statements
5. **Lease Options**: Understand value of renewal/expansion rights

## Negotiation Strategies

### Landlord Negotiation Leverage
- **Consent Required**: Tenant cannot complete transfer without consent
- **Discretion**: Lease may give absolute or near-absolute discretion
- **Timing**: Tenant needs consent by specific closing date
- **Business Opportunity**: Transfer often signals strong tenant demand for space

**Landlord May Seek**:
- Rent increase to market (if significantly below market)
- Extension of term
- Removal of unfavorable options (termination, expansion)
- Additional security (guarantee, larger deposit, letter of credit)
- Lease clarifications or amendments
- Recovery of transaction costs

### Tenant Negotiation Leverage
- **Reasonableness Obligation**: Landlord may be required to act reasonably
- **Business Relationship**: Tenant in good standing with leverage
- **Strong New Shareholder**: Better credit than original shareholder
- **Market Position**: Tenant below market rent has less leverage
- **Legal Recourse**: Unreasonable refusal may be challengeable

**Tenant May Seek**:
- Fast-track approval process
- Cost cap or waiver
- Confirm no rent increase
- Preserve all lease options
- No additional security requirements
- General consent for future transfers to affiliates

### Compromise Positions
1. **Financial Guarantee**: New shareholder provides limited guarantee (e.g., 12 months rent) instead of rent increase
2. **Rent Review**: Agree to market rent review at next renewal instead of immediate increase
3. **Cost Sharing**: Split landlord's legal costs 50/50
4. **Information Rights**: Landlord receives annual financial statements from new shareholder
5. **Estoppel Exchange**: Tenant receives estoppel concurrent with consent execution
6. **Notice Procedure**: Establish streamlined procedure for future related-party transfers

## Template & Precedent Notes

### Template Customization
This precedent is for **Ontario commercial leases**. Adapt for other jurisdictions:

**Quebec**:
- Civil Code references instead of common law
- Different privacy legislation (Bill 64)
- Two-witness requirement for individual signatories
- French language version may be required

**Other Common Law Provinces**:
- Provincial corporate statutes differ
- Privacy legislation varies
- Court jurisdiction clauses adjusted
- Governing law clause changed

**United States**:
- State-specific corporate law
- Federal and state privacy laws
- Different signature block conventions
- Notarization may be required

### Precedent Adaptation
**For Specific Sectors**:
- **Retail**: Address tenant mix and exclusive use provisions
- **Industrial**: Emphasize hazmat/environmental compliance continuity
- **Office**: Professional image and building standard provisions
- **Ground Lease**: More stringent due diligence and landlord consent provisions

**For Deal Structures**:
- **Partial Transfer**: Adjust for less than 100% share transfer
- **Multiple Shareholders**: More complex shareholding chart
- **Indirect Transfer**: Change in parent company or upstream shareholder
- **Merger/Acquisition**: Different structure than simple share purchase

## Use Cases & Examples

### Example 1: Retirement Succession
**Scenario**: Founding shareholder retiring, selling to long-time employee

**Landlord Analysis**:
- ✓ Business continuity excellent (employee knows operations)
- ✓ No business change
- ⚠ New shareholder financial strength (less net worth than founder)

**Resolution**: Landlord consents with outgoing shareholder guarantee for 12 months to bridge transition

### Example 2: Private Equity Acquisition
**Scenario**: Private equity fund acquiring tenant company

**Landlord Analysis**:
- ✓ Strong financial backing (PE fund)
- ⚠ Potential business changes (PE optimization)
- ⚠ Flipping risk (PE 3-5 year hold period)

**Resolution**: Landlord consents but requires quarterly financial reporting and removes termination option

### Example 3: Arm's Length Corporate Acquisition
**Scenario**: Competitor acquiring tenant company, consolidating operations

**Landlord Analysis**:
- ⚠ Business operations will change (consolidation planned)
- ⚠ Potential vacancy risk (acquiring company has other locations)
- ✓ Strong acquirer financials

**Resolution**: Landlord conditional consent requiring sublease consent if space not used directly

### Example 4: Family Succession
**Scenario**: Parent transferring shares to adult children

**Landlord Analysis**:
- ✓ Family relationship (often permitted transfer under lease)
- ⚠ Next generation experience and financial capacity
- ✓ Business continuity (gradual transition)

**Resolution**: Landlord provides streamlined consent with parent maintaining guarantee

### Example 5: Financial Restructuring
**Scenario**: Creditors forcing share transfer as part of workout

**Landlord Analysis**:
- ⚠ Financial distress signal
- ⚠ Business operations uncertainty
- ⚠ New shareholder turnaround specialist

**Resolution**: Landlord consent conditional on rent arrears cure, security deposit increase, and updated insurance

## Common Questions & Issues

### Q1: Is landlord consent always required for share transfers?
**A**: Depends on lease language. Most commercial leases restrict "change in control" which includes share transfers. However, some leases:
- Only restrict direct assignments, not share transfers
- Exempt transfers of less than 50% of shares
- Exempt transfers if tenant is public company
- Exempt family and affiliate transfers

**Check**: The specific lease provision and any defined terms for "Transfer" or "assignment".

### Q2: Can landlord unreasonably withhold consent?
**A**: Depends on lease language and jurisdiction:
- **"Not to be unreasonably withheld"**: Landlord must act reasonably
- **"Sole and absolute discretion"**: Landlord has wide discretion (but may still be reasonableness implied by law)
- **No standard stated**: Jurisdiction-dependent (some imply reasonableness, others do not)

**Reasonable grounds for refusal** generally include:
- Materially weaker financial strength
- Proposed business change violates lease
- New shareholder poor track record at other properties
- Outstanding defaults under lease

### Q3: What information can landlord reasonably request?
**A**: Typically reasonable:
- New shareholder legal name, incorporation details, principals
- Financial statements (3 years) or net worth certification
- Credit report
- Business plan and description of operations
- References
- Copy of share purchase agreement or summary of transaction

**Unreasonable requests**:
- Commercially sensitive information unrelated to creditworthiness
- Trade secrets or competitive information
- Purchase price (debatable - some jurisdictions allow, others don't)
- Information about parties not involved in lease

### Q4: How much are landlord's legal costs typically?
**A**: Varies by market and complexity:
- **Simple consent, no issues**: $1,500 - $2,500
- **Standard consent, due diligence required**: $2,500 - $5,000
- **Complex negotiation, multiple parties**: $5,000 - $10,000+

**Unreasonable costs**:
- Excessive time spent on routine matter
- Costs for non-legal administrative tasks
- Double billing (tenant pays direct + markup)

**Tenant protection**: Request detailed invoice or cap costs in advance

### Q5: What if tenant completes share transfer without consent?
**A**: Potential consequences:
- **Lease Default**: Unauthorized transfer is material default
- **Termination Right**: Landlord may have right to terminate lease
- **Damages**: Landlord may claim damages for breach
- **Distraint**: Landlord may distrain on tenant's goods for unpaid rent during default
- **No Cure**: May be non-remediable default (transfer cannot be "undone")

**Practical outcome**: Landlord typically seeks leverage to renegotiate lease terms rather than immediate termination

### Q6: Does new shareholder need to sign the consent agreement?
**A**: **Yes, strongly recommended**. While legally tenant is the only party that needs to be bound (tenant remains the lessee), having new shareholder sign:
- Provides landlord with direct relationship with new controlling party
- Binds new shareholder to representations and privacy consents
- Confirms new shareholder's knowledge and acceptance of lease
- Facilitates future communications with actual controlling party

### Q7: What is the difference between share transfer consent and assignment consent?
**A**:

| **Share Transfer Consent** | **Assignment Consent** |
|---|---|
| Tenant legal entity remains same | New tenant entity |
| Beneficial ownership changes | Legal ownership changes |
| Original tenant remains on lease | Original tenant released (usually) |
| Landlord-tenant relationship continues | New landlord-tenant relationship |
| Less complex (same entity, covenants) | More complex (assumption, release) |
| Usually lower risk to landlord | Usually higher risk to landlord |
| Legal costs typically lower | Legal costs typically higher |

### Q8: Can landlord charge a "consent fee" separate from legal costs?
**A**: Depends on lease language and jurisdiction:
- Some leases explicitly provide for administrative or processing fee ($500-$2,500)
- If lease is silent, landlord cannot typically charge fee beyond reasonable legal costs
- Some jurisdictions regulate or prohibit consent fees
- **Negotiable**: Even if not in lease, tenant may agree to pay fee to expedite consent

### Q9: What if original shareholder is retaining partial interest?
**A**: Consent agreement should be adapted:
- Recitals describe partial transfer (e.g., "50% of shares")
- Original shareholder may remain partially involved
- New shareholder obtains "control" or "majority interest" rather than 100%
- May have two new shareholders if multiple parties acquiring
- Landlord may request shareholders' agreement to understand governance

### Q10: Does consent expire or have a time limit?
**A**: Generally no, but:
- Consent is specific to the transaction described in the agreement
- If transaction does not close by effective date stated, may need updated consent for new closing date
- Material changes to transaction (different new shareholder, different percentage) require new consent
- Landlord may impose condition that consent expires if not closed within timeframe (e.g., 90 days)
