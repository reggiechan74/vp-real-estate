    "description": "Acquisition of permanent easement rights across 12 agricultural properties (total 450 acres) for 500kV transmission line corridor. Corridor width: 80 meters. Total corridor area: 145 acres (32% of affected properties). Project connects renewable energy generation in the north to urban demand centers.",
    "rationale": "Critical infrastructure to support provincial renewable energy targets and grid reliability. Transmission capacity bottleneck identified in 2023 Long-Term Energy Plan. Delay risks $2.5B in stranded renewable generation capacity and reliability issues for 500,000 customers. Route selection completed after 18-month environmental assessment and public consultation.",
    "urgency": "high",
    "background": "Provincial government directed Hydro Corporation to proceed with transmission expansion in 2023. Environmental Assessment approval received October 2024. Three alternative routes evaluated - selected route minimizes residential impacts and wetland crossings. Ontario Energy Board approval anticipated Q1 2026.",
