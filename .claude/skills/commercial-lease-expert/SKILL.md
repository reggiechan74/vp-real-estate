## Core Expertise

### Property Types and Lease Structures

**Primary Focus**:
1. **Multi-Tenant Industrial** - Warehouse, distribution, light manufacturing
2. **Single-Tenant Industrial** - Build-to-suit, sale-leaseback, distribution centers
3. **Multi-Tenant Office** - Class A/B/C office buildings
4. **Single-Tenant Office** - Corporate headquarters, professional buildings

**Net Lease Structures**:

**Gross Lease**:
- Landlord pays all operating expenses
- Tenant pays only base rent
- Rare in modern commercial leases
- Higher base rent to cover landlord's costs

**Modified Gross (Base Year)**:
- Base year operating costs established (typically Year 1)
- Tenant pays proportionate share of increases above base year
- Common in office leases
- Protects landlord from inflation while giving tenant cost certainty

**Net Lease**:
- Tenant pays base rent PLUS proportionate share of operating expenses
- Standard for multi-tenant industrial and office
- Three components: Base Rent + Operating Costs + Additional Rent

**Triple Net (NNN)**:
- Tenant pays base rent plus ALL property expenses
- Typical for single-tenant properties
- Tenant responsible for: taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance, repairs, management
- Landlord receives "net" rent with minimal obligations

**Key Formula**:
```
Total Rent = Base Rent + (Proportionate Share × Operating Expenses) + Additional Rent
```

### Lease Economics Fundamentals

**1. Base Rent**:
- Quoted as $/sf/year (e.g., $10.00/sf/year)
- Usually paid monthly (divide by 12)
- May have escalations (fixed % or CPI-indexed)
- May have free rent periods (months 1-3)

**Example**:
```
Premises: 50,000 sf
Base Rent: $9.50/sf/year
Monthly Payment: (50,000 × $9.50) / 12 = $39,583.33/month
```

**2. Proportionate Share**:
- Tenant's share of building operating expenses
- Formula: Rentable Area of Premises ÷ Total Rentable Area of Building
- Applied to: Operating costs, realty taxes, insurance

**Example**:
```
Tenant Space: 50,000 sf
Building Total: 200,000 sf
Proportionate Share: 50,000 / 200,000 = 25%

If Building Operating Costs = $800,000/year
Tenant's Share = $800,000 × 25% = $200,000/year ($4.00/sf)
```

**3. Operating Costs (Opex)**:

**Typically Include**:
- Property taxes and assessments
- Building insurance
- Common area maintenance (CAM)
- Utilities for common areas
- Repairs and maintenance (roof, structure, systems)
- Property management fees
- Security
- Landscaping and snow removal
- Janitorial (common areas)

**Typically Exclude**:
- Capital expenditures (>$10K, >1 year useful life)
- Leasing commissions and tenant inducements
- Financing costs (mortgage interest)
- Landlord's income taxes
- Costs recoverable from other tenants specifically
- Costs of landlord's suite

**Management Fees**:
- Multi-tenant: 5% of gross rent
- Single-tenant (landlord managed): 3% of gross rent
- Single-tenant (tenant managed): 2.75% of gross rent

**4. Additional Rent**:
- All amounts payable by tenant beyond base rent
- Operating cost share
- Realty tax share
- Utilities (if separately metered)
- Insurance premiums
- Late fees, interest charges
- Cost of tenant defaults

### Measurement Standards

**Industrial (ANSI/BOMA Z65.2-2012 Method A)**:
- Measures to inside finished surface of exterior walls
- Includes columns, projections
- Excludes exterior walls if multi-tenant
- Load factor typically 5-10%

**Office (ANSI/BOMA Office Buildings Standard)**:
- Usable Area: Actual space tenant occupies
- Rentable Area: Usable + Common Area Factor
- Common Area: Lobbies, corridors, restrooms, mechanical
- Load factor typically 10-20% (15% average)

**Key Formula**:
```
Rentable Area = Usable Area × (1 + Load Factor)

Example:
Usable: 10,000 sf
Load Factor: 15%
Rentable: 10,000 × 1.15 = 11,500 sf (tenant pays for 11,500 sf)
```

### Critical Lease Terms and Provisions

**1. Term and Renewal Options**:

**Initial Term**:
- Typically 5-10 years
- Longer terms (10-20 years) for build-to-suit or heavy tenant investment
- Shorter terms (3-5 years) for weak tenants or uncertain markets

**Renewal Options**:
- Tenant's unilateral right to extend (not landlord's)
- Typically 1-3 options of 5 years each
- Rent: Fixed increase, CPI-indexed, or fair market value
- Notice required: 6-12 months before expiry

**Sample Clause**:
```
"Tenant shall have two (2) options to extend the Term for additional
periods of five (5) years each, exercisable by notice to Landlord
not less than nine (9) months before expiry, at 95% of Fair Market
Rental Value, as determined by arbitration if necessary."
```

**2. Rent Escalations**:

**Fixed Escalation**:
- 2-3% per year typical
- Simple and predictable
- May not keep pace with inflation

**CPI-Indexed**:
- Tied to Consumer Price Index
- Floor (minimum increase): 0-2%
- Cap (maximum increase): 4-6%
- More common in longer-term leases

**Fair Market Value Reset**:
- Rent adjusted to market at intervals (every 5 years)
- Usually determined by arbitration
- Provides landlord protection in rising markets

**Sample Clause**:
```
"Base Rent shall increase annually on each anniversary of the
Commencement Date by the greater of: (i) 2.5%, or (ii) the
percentage increase in CPI, to a maximum of 5%."
```

**3. Use Clause**:

**Broad vs. Narrow**:
- **Tenant preference**: Broad use (maximum flexibility)
- **Landlord preference**: Narrow use (control tenant mix, avoid conflicts)

**Examples**:
- Narrow: "General office purposes only"
- Medium: "Warehouse and distribution of consumer goods"
- Broad: "Any lawful purpose"

**Key Considerations**:
- Zoning compliance
- Permitted uses under building lease/restrictions
- Compatibility with other tenants
- Environmental restrictions (hazmat)
- Impact on insurance rates

**4. Assignment and Subletting**:

**Standard Provision** (Landlord-Friendly):
- Tenant cannot assign or sublet without landlord's consent
- Landlord's consent not to be unreasonably withheld
- Landlord may charge fee (legal costs, admin)
- Landlord may recapture space (take back for own leasing)

**Tenant Improvements**:
- Allow transfers to affiliates without consent
- Eliminate recapture right
- Limit landlord's approval criteria
- Profit-sharing on sublease (if rent higher than base rent)

**Sample Tenant-Friendly Clause**:
```
"Tenant may assign or sublet to any Affiliate without Landlord's
consent. For third-party assignments, Landlord's consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Landlord shall not have right
to recapture. Tenant may retain 50% of any profit from sublease
after deducting transaction costs."
```

**5. Permitted Alterations**:

**Categories**:
- **Cosmetic**: Paint, carpet - usually permitted without consent
- **Non-Structural**: Partitions, fixtures - consent required (not to be unreasonably withheld)
- **Structural**: Affects building structure or systems - consent required (landlord's discretion)

**Tenant Considerations**:
- Pre-approved list of alterations
- Streamlined approval process
- No removal requirement at lease end
- Tenant owns removable fixtures

**Landlord Protections**:
- Review and approve plans
- Ensure proper insurance and contractors
- Require removal and restoration for specialized alterations
- Lien protection (holdback or waiver of lien)

**6. Repair and Maintenance**:

**Typical Allocation**:

**Landlord Responsibility**:
- Roof and structure
- Foundation and exterior walls
- Building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing) - capital repairs
- Common areas
- Parking lot and landscaping

**Tenant Responsibility**:
- Interior of premises (walls, floors, ceilings)
- Fixtures and improvements
- HVAC maintenance within premises
- Plate glass
- Compliance with laws for tenant's use

**Key Issues**:
- Who pays for HVAC repairs/replacement? (often shared based on cost threshold)
- What is "structural" vs. tenant obligation?
- Capital vs. operating expenses
- Condition at lease end (yield-up clause)

**7. Insurance Requirements**:

**Tenant's Required Insurance**:

**Commercial General Liability (CGL)**:
- Minimum: $2M-$5M per occurrence
- Comprehensive form
- Landlord as additional insured
- Cross-liability coverage

**Property Insurance**:
- All-risk coverage
- Full replacement cost
- Tenant's improvements and contents
- Business interruption (12 months)

**Other**:
- Automobile liability: $2M
- Employer's liability (if employees)
- Environmental liability (if hazmat)

**Landlord's Insurance**:

- Landlord's liability insurance
- Loss of rent insurance
- Cost recovered through operating expenses

**Mutual Waiver of Subrogation**:
- Both parties waive claims against each other for insured losses
- Prevents insurance company from suing other party
- Standard provision

**8. Tenant Inducements**:

**Common Inducements**:

**Tenant Improvement Allowance (TI)**:
- $$/sf allowance for leasehold improvements
- Typical: $10-$50/sf depending on property type and condition
- Office higher than industrial
- "Vanilla shell" vs. "as-is" condition

**Free Rent**:
- Months 1-3 (or more) rent-free
- Allows tenant to complete fit-up and move in
- Typical: 1-6 months depending on term and market

**Moving Allowance**:
- Reimbursement of tenant's moving costs
- Typical: $5,000-$25,000

**Broker Commission**:
- Paid by landlord to tenant's broker
- Not direct inducement but affects deal economics
- Typical: 4-6% of gross rent over term

**Rent Abatement**:
- Reduced rent during initial period
- Example: 50% off for first 6 months

**Key Concept - Effective Rent**:
- Net present value of rent over term after accounting for inducements
- Allows apples-to-apples comparison of deals
- Formula: (Total Rent - Inducements) / Term

**9. Default and Remedies**:

**Tenant Events of Default**:
1. Non-payment of rent (5-10 day cure period)
2. Breach of covenants (15-30 day cure period)

2. **Repair Obligations**:
   - Limit tenant's structural repair obligations
   - Cap on tenant's share of roof/HVAC repairs
   - Clear allocation of responsibilities
   - "As is" vs. "deliver in good condition"

3. **Exit Strategy**:
   - Renewal options at favorable terms
   - Early termination rights
   - Broad assignment/sublet rights
   - Clear yield-up requirements

**3. Landlord Negotiation Priorities**:

**Economic Terms**:
1. **Maximize Rental Income**:
   - Market or above-market base rent
   - Regular escalations (3%+ or CPI with floor)

**Term Length vs. Options**:
- Longer initial term with fewer options (landlord prefers)
- Shorter initial term with more options (tenant prefers)
- Consider: Market cycle, tenant's business certainty

**Fixed vs. CPI Escalations**:
- Fixed easier to budget (tenant prefers if inflation expected)
- CPI protects against inflation (landlord prefers)

**Gross vs. Net Lease**:
- Gross lease = higher base rent, no opex surprises (tenant prefers)
- Net lease = lower base rent, tenant pays actual opex (landlord prefers)
- Compromise: Base year structure

**Broad vs. Narrow Use**:
- Broad use = flexibility (tenant prefers)
- Narrow use = control (landlord prefers)
- Compromise: Defined use with "and related purposes"

consisting of 5 reserved spaces near entrance and 95 common parking
spaces."
```

**8. Early Termination Right**:
```
"Tenant may terminate this Lease effective as of the end of Year 5
by providing 12 months' prior notice and payment of a termination
fee equal to six (6) months' Base Rent."
```
