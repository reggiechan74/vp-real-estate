You are an expert in calculating loss of value to remainder parcels resulting from partial property takings, providing detailed methodology for quantifying severance damages across access, shape, utility, and agricultural operation impacts.

## Granular Focus

Calculating loss of value to remainder parcels (subset of partial taking expertise). This skill provides deep, focused methodology for quantifying specific types of severance damages - NOT general partial taking theory.

## Access Impairment Analysis

Quantifying reduced access value from loss of frontage, circuitous access, or landlocked conditions.

### Direct Frontage Loss ($/Linear Foot by Road Classification)

**Methodology**: Value contribution of road frontage analyzed by linear foot based on road classification and development potential.

**Highway frontage (400-series, divided highway)**:
- **Commercial development potential**: $500-$1,500/linear foot
- **Industrial development potential**: $300-$800/linear foot
- **Residential development potential**: $150-$400/linear foot

**Arterial road (4+ lanes, signalized intersections)**:
- **Commercial**: $300-$800/linear foot
- **Industrial**: $200-$500/linear foot
- **Residential**: $100-$250/linear foot

**Collector road (2-4 lanes, local significance)**:
- **Commercial**: $150-$400/linear foot
- **Industrial**: $100-$300/linear foot
- **Residential**: $50-$150/linear foot

**Local road (2 lanes, residential access)**:
- **Residential**: $25-$75/linear foot
- **Agricultural**: $10-$30/linear foot

**Example calculation**:
- **Before**: 200 acres with 800 linear feet of highway frontage, valued at $40,000/acre = $8,000,000 total
- **After taking**: Highway widening takes 50-foot strip along entire frontage, removing all direct highway access
- **Frontage value component**: 800 LF × $600/LF (industrial development) = $480,000
- **Remainder value**: $8,000,000 - $480,000 (frontage premium) = $7,520,000 baseline + frontage loss
- **Severance damage**: **$480,000** for loss of direct highway access

### Circuitous Access (Time-Distance Modeling, Traffic Counts)

**Methodology**: Quantify value loss from increased travel time/distance to reach remainder parcel after taking eliminates direct access.

**Time-distance modeling**:
- Measure travel time before and after taking
- Apply value-of-time metric (typically $25-$50/hour for commercial/industrial users)
- Capitalize annual time cost to determine value loss

**Example (industrial property)**:
- **Before**: Direct access to arterial road, 2-minute travel to highway interchange
- **After**: Taking eliminates direct access, requires 3 km detour via local roads, 8-minute travel to highway
- **Additional time**: 6 minutes each way = 12 minutes/day
- **Annual time cost**: 250 business days × 12 min/day × (1 hr/60 min) × $40/hr × 20 trips/day = $40,000/year
- **Capitalization**: $40,000 ÷ 7% cap rate = **$571,000 severance damage**

**Traffic count impact**:
- Loss of high-traffic frontage reduces commercial visibility
- Quantified as percentage reduction in sales/rent potential
- Example: Commercial property loses 15,000 vehicles/day frontage, gains 3,000 vehicles/day frontage → 80% traffic loss → 10-20% reduction in rent potential → capitalized value loss

### Landlocked Parcel Remedies (Easement Costs, Value Impact)

**Scenario**: Partial taking severs access, creating landlocked remainder with no legal access to public road.

**Remedies and costs**:

1. **Acquire access easement from adjacent landowner**:
   - Easement value: 10-15% of fee simple value for affected land
   - Legal costs: $15K-$30K
   - Survey and registration: $5K-$10K
   - **Total cost**: Easement value + $20K-$40K transaction costs

2. **Necessity easement (court-ordered)**:
   - Legal proceedings: $50K-$150K
   - Court-awarded easement compensation: 10-15% of fee simple
   - Delay and uncertainty (1-3 years)
   - **Total cost**: Easement value + $50K-$150K legal fees + time cost

3. **Value impact if no easement obtainable**:
   - Landlocked land: 50-80% reduction in value (agricultural use only via aerial/helicopter access for specialty crops)
   - Effectively sterilized for most development purposes

**Example calculation**:
- **Remainder**: 50 acres, agricultural use, $15,000/acre = $750,000
- **Access loss**: Landlocked, requires 200-meter easement across adjacent property
- **Easement cost**: 0.5 acres × $15,000/acre × 12% = $900 + $25,000 legal/survey = **$25,900**
- **Alternatively - value loss if no easement**: $750,000 × 60% reduction = **$450,000** (use lower if easement obtainable, higher if not)
- **Severance damage**: **$25,900** (cost-to-cure) or **$450,000** (value loss if no cure)

## Shape Irregularity

Valuing odd-shaped remainders resulting from takings that create inefficient parcel configurations.

### Geometric Efficiency Ratios (Area to Perimeter)

**Methodology**: Quantify shape inefficiency using area-to-perimeter ratio, comparing before/after taking.

**Optimal shapes** (efficient for development):
- **Square**: Area/Perimeter ratio = L²/4L = L/4 (maximum efficiency for rectangle)
- **Circle**: Area/Perimeter ratio = πr²/2πr = r/2 (theoretical maximum efficiency)
- **Regular rectangle** (2:1 ratio): Moderately efficient

**Inefficient shapes**:
- **Long, narrow strip** (10:1+ ratio): Very inefficient
- **Triangular**: Moderate inefficiency
- **Irregular polygon** (multiple angles, re-entrants): High inefficiency

**Efficiency index calculation**:
- **Efficiency Index** = (Actual Area ÷ Actual Perimeter) ÷ (Square Area ÷ Square Perimeter)
- Index = 1.0 = Perfect square efficiency
- Index = 0.8-1.0 = High efficiency (minimal value loss)
- Index = 0.6-0.8 = Moderate efficiency (5-10% value loss)
- Index = 0.4-0.6 = Low efficiency (10-20% value loss)
- Index <0.4 = Very low efficiency (20-40% value loss)

**Example**:
- **Before**: 100-acre parcel, roughly square (2,000 ft × 2,000 ft), perimeter = 8,000 LF
  - Efficiency Index = (100 acres ÷ 8,000 LF) ÷ (100 acres ÷ 8,000 LF) = 1.0
- **After**: 60-acre remainder, long narrow strip (400 ft × 6,000 ft), perimeter = 12,800 LF
  - Efficiency Index = (60 acres ÷ 12,800 LF) ÷ (Square 60 acres ÷ 7,760 LF) = 0.61
- **Shape inefficiency**: Moderate (0.6-0.8 range) → **8% value reduction**
- **Severance damage**: 60 acres × $15,000/acre × 8% = **$72,000**

### Development Yield Analysis (Buildable Area Calculations)

**Methodology**: Calculate reduction in developable units/area from shape constraints.

**Residential subdivision example**:

**Before**:
- 50 acres, regular shape, medium-density zoning (10 units/acre)
- Developable area: 50 acres - 15% (roads/parks) = 42.5 acres
- **Yield**: 42.5 acres × 10 units/acre = **425 units**
- **Value**: 425 units × $150,000/unit = $63.75M

**After (taking creates irregular remainder)**:
- 35 acres, irregular "L" shape with two narrow arms
- Developable area: 35 acres - 20% (roads/parks - higher % due to irregular layout) = 28 acres
- Inefficient lot layout: Many lots sub-standard depth or width
- **Yield**: 28 acres × 8 units/acre (reduced density) = **224 units**
- **Value**: 224 units × $150,000/unit = $33.6M

**Severance damage calculation**:
- **Before (proportionate)**: $63.75M × (35 acres ÷ 50 acres) = $44.625M
- **After**: $33.6M
- **Severance damage**: $44.625M - $33.6M = **$11.025M** (24.7% reduction)

**Alternative methodology (per-acre impact)**:
- Before: $63.75M ÷ 50 acres = $1,275,000/acre
- After: $33.6M ÷ 35 acres = $960,000/acre
- **Severance damage**: ($1,275,000 - $960,000) × 35 acres = **$11.025M**

### Comparable Sales of Irregular Parcels

**Methodology**: Market extraction showing discount for irregular shapes.

**Paired sales**:

**Sale 1** (regular shape):
- 20 acres, square configuration, zoned commercial
- Sale price: $80,000/acre = $1,600,000

**Sale 2** (irregular shape):
- 22 acres, long narrow strip (300 ft × 3,200 ft), zoned commercial
- Sale price: $65,000/acre = $1,430,000
- Time/location adjusted: $66,500/acre

**Shape discount**: ($80,000 - $66,500) ÷ $80,000 = **16.9% reduction** for irregular shape

**Application to subject**:
- Remainder: 40 acres, irregular after taking
- Comparable irregular sales: 15-20% discount
- Adopted shape discount: **17%**
- Fee simple value (if regular): $80,000/acre
- **Actual value (irregular)**: $80,000 × (1 - 0.17) = **$66,400/acre**
- **Severance damage**: $80,000 - $66,400 = **$13,600/acre** × 40 acres = **$544,000**

## Utility Impairment

Functional obsolescence from division - loss of highest and best use or reduced development potential.

### Loss of Highest and Best Use (Zoning-Permitted vs. Achievable)

**Scenario**: Taking reduces parcel size below minimum for zoning-permitted use, forcing less valuable use.

**Example (industrial subdivision)**:

**Before**:
- 100 acres, zoned "Employment - Prestige Industrial"
- Minimum lot size: 5 acres per zoning
- Highest and best use: Subdivision into 18 × 5-acre lots (10% for roads)
- Value: 18 lots × $500,000/lot = **$9,000,000** ($90,000/acre)

**After**:
- 65 acres remain (35 acres taken for highway)
- Still zoned "Employment - Prestige Industrial"
- **Problem**: Irregular shape yields only 10 × 5-acre lots (instead of proportionate 11.7 lots)
- **Alternative use**: General industrial (no minimum lot size) at lower value
  - Value as general industrial: 65 acres × $60,000/acre = **$3,900,000**
  - Value if could maintain prestige industrial subdivision: 11.7 lots × $500,000 = **$5,850,000**

**Severance damage**: **$5,850,000** (proportionate before value) - **$3,900,000** (after value) = **$1,950,000** (33% reduction)

### Reduced Development Potential (Unit Count, Parking Ratios)

**Scenario**: Taking creates site constraints that reduce developable area or building footprint.

**Example (commercial development)**:

**Before**:
- 10 acres, regular rectangle, highway frontage, zoned commercial
- Maximum lot coverage: 40%
- Parking requirement: 4 spaces/1,000 sq ft GLA
- **Buildable area**: 10 acres × 40% = 4 acres = 174,240 sq ft
- **Parking demand**: 174,240 ÷ 1,000 × 4 = 697 spaces
- **Parking area**: 697 spaces × 350 sq ft/space = 243,950 sq ft = 5.6 acres
- **Site capacity**: 174,240 sq ft building + 243,950 sq ft parking = 9.6 acres (fits)
- **Value**: 174,240 sq ft × $250/sq ft = **$43.56M**

**After**:
- 7 acres remain (irregular "L" shape after 3-acre corner taking)
- Buildable area still 40% coverage = 2.8 acres = 121,968 sq ft (theoretical)
- **Problem**: Irregular shape constrains building footprint to 90,000 sq ft maximum
- **Parking demand**: 90,000 ÷ 1,000 × 4 = 360 spaces
- **Parking area**: 360 spaces × 350 sq ft = 126,000 sq ft = 2.9 acres
- **Total requirement**: 90,000 sq ft building (2.07 acres) + 2.9 acres parking = 4.97 acres (fits, but reduced from potential)
- **Value**: 90,000 sq ft × $250/sq ft = **$22.5M**

**Severance damage calculation**:
- **Before (proportionate)**: $43.56M × (7 acres ÷ 10 acres) = **$30.49M**
- **After**: **$22.5M**
- **Severance damage**: $30.49M - $22.5M = **$7.99M** (26% reduction)

### Site Servicing Complications (Utilities, Drainage)

**Scenario**: Taking severs utility connections or disrupts drainage patterns, requiring costly remediation.

**Utility relocation costs**:
- **Water main relocation**: $300-$600/linear meter
- **Sanitary sewer relocation**: $500-$1,000/linear meter
- **Electrical distribution**: $200-$400/linear meter
- **Gas main**: $150-$350/linear meter

**Example**:
- Taking severs water and sewer connections to remainder
- Requires 400 meters of new water/sewer mains to reconnect
- **Cost**: 400m × $500/m (water) + 400m × $800/m (sewer) = **$520,000**

**Drainage disruption**:
- Taking alters grading, creating ponding/flooding on remainder
- Requires new storm sewer system or grading modifications
- **Cost**: Engineering $15K + construction $180K = **$195,000**

**Total site servicing severance**: $520,000 + $195,000 = **$715,000**

## Farm Operation Disruption

Agricultural severance impacts from field division, equipment access complications, and irrigation system impacts.

### Field Division Costs (Fence Installation, Drainage Modifications)

**Fencing costs** (to separate taking from remainder):
- **Agricultural fence** (4-strand barbed wire): $8-$12/linear meter
- **Page wire fence** (livestock): $15-$25/linear meter
- **Chain link fence** (6-foot, industrial): $80-$120/linear meter

**Example**:
- Taking bisects farm, requires 2,000 meters of new fence
- Livestock operation requires page wire
- **Fencing cost**: 2,000m × $20/m = **$40,000**

**Drainage modifications**:
- Taking disrupts tile drainage system serving 50 acres
- Requires new outlet and 1,500 meters of tile drainage to reconnect
- **Cost**: Engineering $8K + tile installation $15/m × 1,500m = **$30,500**

**Total field division costs**: $40,000 + $30,500 = **$70,500**

### Equipment Access Complications (Turning Radius, Crossing Points)

**Scenario**: Taking creates narrow or landlocked fields requiring circuitous equipment access.

**Time-cost analysis**:
- **Before**: 200-acre farm, efficient field layout, 2 large fields
- **After**: Taking bisects farm into two 100-acre parcels separated by highway
- **Equipment crossing**: Requires 5 km detour to move equipment between fields (no at-grade crossing)
- **Annual time cost**: 30 crossings/year × 5 km detour × 2 ways × 10 km/hr speed × $150/hr equipment+operator = $2,250/year
- **Capitalization**: $2,250 ÷ 7% cap rate = **$32,140**

**Turning radius constraints**:
- Narrow remainder field (150 meters wide) constrains large equipment
- Reduces efficiency by 15% (measured in time per acre)
- Annual cost: 50 acres × $40/acre operating cost × 15% = $300/year
- **Capitalization**: $300 ÷ 7% = **$4,280**

**Total equipment access severance**: $32,140 + $4,280 = **$36,420**

### Irrigation System Impacts (Pivot Circles, Distribution Lines)

**Center pivot irrigation disruption**:

**Scenario**: Taking bisects irrigated field, disrupting center pivot system.

**Before**:
- 160-acre field, 4 center pivots (40 acres each)
- Irrigation value: $2,000/acre premium for irrigated land
- Total irrigation premium: 160 acres × $2,000/acre = $320,000

**After**:
- Taking removes 30 acres, severs distribution lines to 2 pivots
- Remaining 130 acres: 2 pivots functional (80 acres), 2 pivots non-functional (50 acres)
- Non-functional pivots: Requires $180,000 to relocate distribution lines, pump station
- **Alternatives**:
  1. **Repair irrigation**: $180,000 cost to reconnect → 130 acres irrigated
  2. **Abandon irrigation**: 50 acres lose irrigation premium → $100,000 value loss

**Severance damage (cost-to-cure)**: **$180,000** (cost to repair irrigation system)

**Alternative severance damage (value loss if not repaired)**:
- Lost irrigation premium: 50 acres × $2,000/acre = **$100,000**
- Plus inefficiency/loss on remaining pivots: **$20,000**
- **Total**: **$120,000**

**Adopt lower**: **$120,000** severance damage (value loss approach, as owner may not repair)
