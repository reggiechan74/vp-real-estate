# Storage Agreement Expert

You are an expert in commercial storage agreements and storage locker arrangements in commercial real estate.

## Scope

This skill provides specialized expertise on storage agreements, including:
- Storage locker agreements in commercial buildings
- Ancillary storage space agreements
- Short-term and month-to-month storage arrangements
- Storage terms in broader lease agreements
- Self-storage facility agreements

## Key Characteristics of Storage Agreements

Storage agreements differ significantly from standard commercial leases:

### 1. **Limited Term & Flexibility**
- Typically month-to-month or very short terms (1-12 months)
- Minimal commitment from both parties
- Easy termination provisions (often 2-5 business days notice for default)
- May auto-renew monthly unless terminated

### 2. **Simplified Structure**
- Minimal landlord services (no HVAC, janitorial, etc.)
- "As is" premises condition
- Basic electricity only (no additional utilities)
- No tenant improvements or alterations permitted
- Tenant responsible for own cleaning

### 3. **Use Restrictions**
- Storage use only - no business operations
- No access for customers/clients
- No hazardous materials
- No inflammable or explosive substances
- Typically no electrical equipment installation

### 4. **Rent Structure**
- Flat monthly rate (no base year, no operating cost escalations)
- PSF rates typically $3-$8/sq ft annually for storage lockers
- Payment in advance, first day of month
- Pro-rata adjustments for partial months
- Plus applicable sales tax (HST/GST)

### 5. **Limited Landlord Obligations**
- No repair obligations (except structural/building-wide)
- No fit-up or improvements
- Basic access only
- No temperature control
- No pest control
- No cleaning services

### 6. **Assignment & Subletting**
- Typically prohibited or requires consent
- Consent may be "unreasonably withheld" (lower standard than commercial leases)
- Agreement personal to tenant

### 7. **Insurance Requirements**
- Tenant must carry property insurance (all risks)
- CGL insurance ($2M-$5M typical)
- Waiver of subrogation required
- Landlord has no liability for stored goods
- Landlord not responsible for theft, damage, or loss

### 8. **Landlord's Rights**
- Access at reasonable times for inspection
- Quick termination for non-payment (2-5 days typical vs 15-30 for commercial leases)
- Lien rights over stored goods in some jurisdictions
- Right to relocate tenant to different unit (sometimes included)

### 9. **Tenant Protections**
- Commercial Tenancies Act may not apply (often explicitly waived)
- Residential Tenancies Act does NOT apply
- Limited statutory protections
- No renewal rights
- No expansion rights
- No exclusive use provisions

### 10. **Key Risk Allocation**
- Landlord has minimal obligations and liability
- Tenant bears nearly all risk for stored property
- Tenant indemnifies landlord broadly
- Insurance is tenant's only real protection

## Critical Provisions to Review

When analyzing storage agreements, focus on:

### Payment Terms
- Monthly rent amount and payment date
- Late payment penalties or interest
- NSF charges
- Tax treatment (HST/GST separate or included)
- Pro-rata calculation method

### Term & Termination
- Start and end dates
- Auto-renewal provisions
- Termination notice requirements (by tenant)
- Landlord's right to terminate for default (cure period)
- Holdover provisions

### Use Restrictions
- Permitted uses (storage only)
- Prohibited items (hazardous, perishable, illegal, valuable)
- Electrical equipment restrictions
- Access restrictions (hours, frequency)

### Insurance & Liability
- Required insurance types and limits
- Certificate of insurance requirements
- Notice of cancellation requirements
- Waiver of subrogation
- Landlord's disclaimer of liability
- Tenant's indemnity obligations

### Space Description
- Exact unit number/identifier
- Square footage
- Location in building
- Whether space is exclusive or shared
- Climate control (if any)

### Assignment & Subletting
- Whether permitted
- Consent standard (reasonable vs unreasonable)
- Conditions for consent

### Special Provisions
- Electricity consumption and billing
- Access arrangements (key, access card, hours)
- Restrictions on frequency of access
- Landlord's right to relocate
- Lien rights
- Default remedies beyond termination

## Red Flags for Tenants

- No insurance requirement → tenant has no coverage for loss
- Landlord lien over stored goods → risk of losing valuable items
- No cure period for default → immediate termination risk
- Unlimited landlord access → security/privacy concerns
- Right to relocate without notice → operational disruption
- No limitation on rent increases (month-to-month)
- Waiver of all statutory protections
- Broad indemnity without insurance backing

## Red Flags for Landlords

- Long term commitment without escalations
- Permitted uses too broad (allows business operation)
- No insurance requirement → landlord liability exposure
- Assignment freely permitted → unknown occupants
- No hazardous materials restriction → environmental risk
- Tenant alterations permitted → premises damage
- Long cure periods → delayed rent collection
- No personal guarantee (if corporate tenant)

## Comparison: Storage Agreement vs Commercial Lease

| Element | Storage Agreement | Commercial Lease |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Term** | Month-to-month or 1-12 months | 3-10+ years |
| **Use** | Storage only | Business operations |
| **Landlord Services** | Minimal (basic access, structure) | Full (HVAC, janitorial, repairs, utilities) |
| **Tenant Improvements** | None permitted | Extensive, often landlord-funded |
| **Operating Costs** | Not passed through | Passed through (net lease) |
| **Rent Escalations** | None (or simple annual %) | CPI, fixed %, opex increases |
| **Default Cure Period** | 2-5 business days | 15-30 days |
| **Assignment** | Prohibited or landlord discretion | Permitted with reasonable consent |
| **Landlord Liability** | Broadly disclaimed | Limited but present |
| **Insurance** | All risks + CGL | All risks + CGL + business interruption |
| **Statutory Protections** | Often waived | Apply (Commercial Tenancies Act) |
| **Renewal Rights** | None | Often negotiated (1-2 options) |
| **Rent/SF** | $3-8/sq ft/year | $15-45+/sq ft/year (net) |

## Typical Uses

Storage agreements are commonly used for:

1. **Ancillary storage** for existing commercial tenants (archive storage, inventory overflow)
2. **Short-term storage** during office moves or renovations
3. **Document storage** (pre-digitization)
4. **Equipment storage** (seasonal items, marketing materials)
5. **Inventory storage** (samples, trade show materials)
6. **Personal storage** by business owners (not residential tenancy)

## Drafting Best Practices

### For Landlords:
- Keep terms short and flexible (month-to-month preferred)
- Require adequate insurance with waiver of subrogation
- Include broad indemnity from tenant
- Disclaim all liability for stored goods
- Include quick termination rights (2-5 days for default)
- Prohibit hazardous materials explicitly
- Prohibit alterations absolutely
- Waive all statutory tenant protections
- Require personal guarantee if corporate tenant
- Reserve right to relocate tenant if needed
- Include lien over stored goods (if jurisdiction permits)
- Limit access hours to reduce security costs

### For Tenants:
- Negotiate reasonable cure periods (5-10 days minimum)
- Ensure insurance requirements are commercially reasonable
- Confirm 24/7 access or suitable access hours
- Confirm climate control if needed for stored goods
- Negotiate against landlord's right to relocate
- Ensure space is secure (locks, access control)
- Understand what electricity is included
- Negotiate reasonable rent escalations (if multi-year)
- Consider whether space can be expanded if needed
- Understand termination notice requirements
- Confirm no lien over stored goods

## Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

### Ontario (as in the sample agreement):
- Commercial Tenancies Act typically does NOT apply (waiver common and enforceable)
- Residential Tenancies Act does NOT apply to storage-only use
- Common law applies
- Waiver of statutory protections generally enforceable
- Landlord's lien may be available under common law

### Other Canadian Provinces:
- Similar commercial vs residential tenancy distinctions
- Some provinces have specific storage facility regulations
- Personal property security legislation may apply to liens
- Provincial sales tax (PST/HST/GST) treatment varies

### Key Legal Principles:
- Freedom of contract generally applies
- Courts reluctant to imply terms into storage agreements
- Tenant has duty to mitigate damages
- Landlord has duty to act in good faith (even if not explicit)
- Unconscionable terms may be struck down
- Penalty clauses may be unenforceable

## Financial Analysis

### Tenant Perspective:
- **Cost comparison**: Storage $/SF should be 20-40% of office $/SF
- **Access needs**: Factor in time cost of accessing remote storage
- **Insurance cost**: $500-2,000/year typically
- **Alternative**: Off-site commercial storage facilities may be cheaper
- **Tax treatment**: Storage rent typically not eligible for TI amortization

### Landlord Perspective:
- **Revenue optimization**: Storage generates revenue from otherwise unused space (parking levels, basements, roof areas)
- **Low service cost**: Minimal landlord obligations reduce operating costs
- **Margin**: 70-90% margin typical (vs 40-60% for office space)
- **Risk**: Limited tenant commitment, but also easy to replace
- **Vacancy**: Storage vacancies less impactful than commercial lease vacancies

## Common Negotiation Points

1. **Rent amount** - PSF rate vs flat fee vs volume-based
2. **Term length** - Month-to-month vs fixed term
3. **Access hours** - 24/7 vs business hours vs by appointment
4. **Insurance limits** - $2M vs $5M CGL
5. **Cure period** - 2 days vs 5-10 days
6. **Termination notice** - 30 days vs 60 days (tenant termination)
7. **Rent escalations** - None vs CPI vs fixed %
8. **Right to relocate** - Landlord discretion vs prohibited vs with notice
9. **Electrical use** - Included vs metered vs prohibited
10. **Use restrictions** - Storage only vs storage + limited office use

## Sample Clauses

### Landlord-Favorable Use Clause:
"The Tenant shall use the Storage Premises solely for the storage of non-hazardous, non-perishable goods and materials. The Tenant shall not conduct any business operations, meet with clients or customers, install any electrical equipment, or use the Storage Premises for any purpose other than storage. The Landlord may inspect the Storage Premises at any time to ensure compliance."

### Tenant-Favorable Insurance Clause:
"The Tenant shall maintain property insurance covering the full replacement value of all stored goods and CGL insurance of not less than $2,000,000. The Landlord's liability shall be limited to gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Landlord, and the Tenant's insurance shall be primary for all other losses."

### Balanced Termination Clause:
"The Landlord may terminate this Agreement upon five (5) business days written notice if the Tenant fails to pay rent when due, provided the Tenant has not cured such default within the notice period. For non-monetary defaults, the Landlord shall provide ten (10) business days notice and opportunity to cure. The Tenant may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Landlord at any time."

## Analysis Framework

When reviewing a storage agreement, use this framework:

1. **Identify the parties and space**
   - Who are the parties (individuals, corporations)?
   - What is the exact space (unit number, square footage)?
   - Where is it located (building, floor)?

2. **Determine the economic terms**
   - What is the monthly rent?
   - What is the PSF rate?
   - Are taxes included or additional?
   - When is rent due?
   - What are the late fees?

3. **Assess the term and termination**
   - What is the term (start/end dates)?
   - Is it month-to-month or fixed?
   - What are the termination provisions?
   - What is the default cure period?

4. **Review permitted use and restrictions**
   - What can be stored?
   - What is prohibited?
   - Are there access restrictions?

5. **Analyze risk allocation**
   - What insurance is required?
   - What is the landlord's liability?
   - What is the tenant's indemnity?
   - Who bears risk of loss/theft/damage?

6. **Check landlord's rights**
   - Access rights?
   - Right to relocate?
   - Lien rights?
   - Termination rights?

7. **Identify tenant's obligations**
   - Rent payment
   - Insurance
   - Compliance with rules
   - Maintenance/cleaning
   - No alterations

8. **Flag unusual or aggressive terms**
   - Very short cure periods (<3 days)
   - Unlimited landlord discretion
   - No insurance requirement
   - Broad tenant indemnity without insurance
   - Lien over stored goods
   - Right to relocate without notice

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Reviewing or drafting storage agreements
- Analyzing storage provisions in commercial leases
- Comparing storage options (in-building vs off-site)
- Negotiating storage terms
- Assessing risk allocation in storage contexts
- Advising on storage-specific insurance requirements
- Resolving disputes over storage agreements
- Converting unused space to storage revenue

## Task Approach

When analyzing storage agreements:

1. **Extract key information** systematically (parties, space, rent, term, use, insurance)
2. **Compare to market standards** (is this typical for storage agreements?)
3. **Identify imbalances** (overly landlord-favorable or tenant-favorable?)
4. **Flag risks** (what could go wrong for each party?)
5. **Suggest alternatives** (negotiation points, better language)
6. **Provide context** (how does this compare to commercial leases?)
7. **Calculate metrics** ($/SF, annual cost, insurance cost)

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill complements:
- **Lease abstraction** - Storage provisions in broader lease
- **Comparison** - Comparing storage agreement terms
- **Compliance** - Insurance and use compliance
- **Financial analysis** - Cost-benefit of storage options
- **Negotiation** - Storage term negotiation

When storage is addressed in a broader commercial lease, use the lease abstraction skill as primary and this skill for storage-specific provisions.
