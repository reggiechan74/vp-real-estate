## Methodology & Assumptions

### Encumbrance Discount Approach

**Individual Discounts:**
- Transmission easements: 5-15% of affected area value
- Pipeline easements: 10-20% of affected area value
- Drainage easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Access easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Conservation easements: 20-50% of affected area value

**Cumulative Discount Formula:**
```
Value × (1-D₁) × (1-D₂) × (1-D₃)
```

This multiplicative approach prevents double-counting and reflects that each encumbrance reduces the remaining value, not the original value.

### Development Potential Adjustment

Development potential considers:
- Restricted buildable area
- Subdivision limitations
- Access and circulation constraints
- Marketability to developers

### Marketability Discount

Marketability discount reflects:
- Reduced buyer pool
- Extended marketing time
- Limited financing options
- Transaction uncertainty
