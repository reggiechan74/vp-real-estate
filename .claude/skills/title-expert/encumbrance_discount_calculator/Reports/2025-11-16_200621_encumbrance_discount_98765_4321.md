**Affected Area:** 30.00 acres (60.0% of property)
**Impact Percentage:** 40.0%
**Typical Range:** 20.0% - 50.0%

**Valuation:**

## Cumulative Discount Calculation

**Method:** Multiplicative

**Calculation:**
Step 1 - conservation_easement: 40.0% discount → Value multiplier = 0.6000 (cumulative discount: 40.00%)
Step 2 - access_easement: 5.0% discount → Value multiplier = 0.5700 (cumulative discount: 43.00%)

**Final Results:**
- Cumulative discount percentage: 43.00%
- Value multiplier: 0.5700
- Total discount amount: $193,200.00
- Value after encumbrances: $456,000.00

**Method Comparison:**

- **Multiplicative:** 43.00% discount (multiplier: 0.5700) - Standard method - most conservative
- **Additive:** 45.00% discount (multiplier: 0.5500) - Simple sum - may overstate discount
- **Geometric Mean:** 24.50% discount (multiplier: 0.7550) - Geometric average - middle ground

## Methodology & Assumptions

### Encumbrance Discount Approach

**Individual Discounts:**
- Transmission easements: 5-15% of affected area value
- Pipeline easements: 10-20% of affected area value
- Drainage easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Access easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Conservation easements: 20-50% of affected area value

**Cumulative Discount Formula:**
```
Value × (1-D₁) × (1-D₂) × (1-D₃)
```

This multiplicative approach prevents double-counting and reflects that each encumbrance reduces the remaining value, not the original value.

### Development Potential Adjustment

Development potential considers:
- Restricted buildable area
- Subdivision limitations
- Access and circulation constraints
- Marketability to developers

### Marketability Discount

Marketability discount reflects:
- Reduced buyer pool
- Extended marketing time
- Limited financing options
- Transaction uncertainty
