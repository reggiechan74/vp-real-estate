## Cumulative Discount Calculation

**Method:** Additive

**Calculation:**
Step 1 - transmission_easement: 10.0% discount → Value multiplier = 0.9000 (cumulative discount: 10.00%)
Step 2 - pipeline_easement: 15.0% discount → Value multiplier = 0.7650 (cumulative discount: 23.50%)
Step 3 - drainage_easement: 5.0% discount → Value multiplier = 0.7268 (cumulative discount: 27.32%)

**Final Results:**
- Cumulative discount percentage: 30.00%
- Value multiplier: 0.7000
- Total discount amount: $12,600.00
- Value after encumbrances: $840,000.00

**Method Comparison:**

- **Multiplicative:** 27.32% discount (multiplier: 0.7268) - Standard method - most conservative
- **Additive:** 30.00% discount (multiplier: 0.7000) - Simple sum - may overstate discount
- **Geometric Mean:** 10.09% discount (multiplier: 0.8991) - Geometric average - middle ground

## Marketability Analysis

**Buyer Pool Impact:**
- Overall impact: High
- Buyer pool reduction: 40%
- Encumbered ratio: 10.0%

**Impact by Encumbrance:**
- **Transmission Easement** (High): Significant reduction in buyer pool - limits financing, development, and owner-occupant appeal
- **Pipeline Easement** (High): Significant reduction in buyer pool - limits financing, development, and owner-occupant appeal
- **Drainage Easement** (Low to Moderate): Moderate reduction in buyer appeal, minimal financing impact

**Financing Impact:**
- Impact level: High
- LTV reduction: 10%
- Typical LTV range: 65-70%
- Significant financing challenges: Lower LTV ratios, higher interest rates, reduced lender pool, may require specialized lenders

**Marketing Challenges:**
- Visual impact: Transmission towers/lines reduce aesthetic appeal
- Safety perception: Pipeline easements raise buyer safety concerns
- Multiple encumbrances: 3 separate easements complicate due diligence
- Reduced financing options: Not all lenders accept encumbered properties
- Enhanced disclosure requirements: Easement terms must be fully disclosed

**Time on Market Impact:**
- Baseline: 90 days
- Additional time: 90 days
- Total estimated: 180 days
- Extended marketing period (4-6 months)

**Marketability Discount:**

## Methodology & Assumptions

### Encumbrance Discount Approach

**Individual Discounts:**
- Transmission easements: 5-15% of affected area value
- Pipeline easements: 10-20% of affected area value
- Drainage easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Access easements: 2-8% of affected area value
- Conservation easements: 20-50% of affected area value

**Cumulative Discount Formula:**
```
Value × (1-D₁) × (1-D₂) × (1-D₃)
```

This multiplicative approach prevents double-counting and reflects that each encumbrance reduces the remaining value, not the original value.

### Development Potential Adjustment

Development potential considers:
- Restricted buildable area
- Subdivision limitations
- Access and circulation constraints
- Marketability to developers

### Marketability Discount

Marketability discount reflects:
- Reduced buyer pool
- Extended marketing time
- Limited financing options
- Transaction uncertainty
