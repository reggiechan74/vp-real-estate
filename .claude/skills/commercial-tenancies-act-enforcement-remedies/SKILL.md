You are an expert in commercial lease enforcement remedies under the Ontario Commercial Tenancies Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, providing strategic guidance on landlord remedies for tenant defaults.

## Granular Focus

Commercial landlord remedies under CTA (subset of Benji's capabilities). This skill provides enforcement strategy for commercial tenancies - NOT residential (covered by RTA).

## Distress for Rent (s.19-22)

Ancient common law remedy allowing landlord to seize and sell tenant's goods to recover rent arrears.

### Goods Subject to Seizure (Tenant's Property, Exemptions)

**Seizure-eligible goods** (tenant's property on premises):
- Office furniture, equipment, computers
- Inventory, stock-in-trade
- Trade fixtures (if removable by tenant)
- Vehicles on premises (if tenant-owned)

**Exemptions** (cannot seize per s.20):
- **Tools of trade**: Up to $2,000 value (protects tenant's ability to earn living)
- **Essential household goods** (if residential component): Beds, clothing, food
- **Third-party goods**: Property owned by others (customer goods in storage, consignment inventory)
- **Perishable goods**: Food, plants (practical exemption - would spoil before sale)

**Landlord's goods** (building fixtures):
- HVAC, plumbing, electrical systems (part of building)
- Built-in shelving, counters (if affixed to building)

**Third-party ownership issues**:
- **Risk**: Seizing goods owned by third parties exposes landlord to conversion liability
- **Verification**: Landlord should verify tenant owns goods before seizure (invoices, bills of sale)
- **Example**: Tenant leases equipment from finance company → landlord seizes equipment → finance company sues for conversion

### Procedural Requirements (Distress Warrant, Bailiff Appointment)

**No court order required**: Distress is self-help remedy (landlord acts without judicial process)

**Bailiff appointment** (s.20):
- Landlord appoints licensed bailiff to seize goods
- Bailiff must be licensed under provincial bailiff licensing regime
- **Unlicensed person**: Seizure void, landlord liable for damages

**Distress warrant**:
- Landlord issues written warrant authorizing bailiff to seize specific goods for specific rent amount
- Must state: Amount owing, premises location, description of goods

**Entry requirements**:
- Bailiff may enter premises during business hours (not forcible entry if locked)
- Cannot break locks or use force against persons

### Sale Process (Notice, Public Auction, Proceeds Distribution)

**Notice of sale** (s.21):
- **To tenant**: 5 days' notice before sale (allows tenant to redeem - pay arrears and stop sale)
- **Public notice**: Advertisement in newspaper (auction notice)

**Public auction**:
- Goods sold at public auction (transparent process, maximize proceeds)
- **Reserve price**: Can set minimum bid (protect against fire-sale prices)

**Proceeds distribution**:
1. **Bailiff fees**: Seizure, storage, auction costs paid first
2. **Rent arrears**: Landlord's claim (amount specified in warrant)
3. **Surplus**: Returned to tenant (if proceeds exceed arrears + fees)

**Example**:
- **Arrears**: $15,000
- **Goods seized**: Office furniture, computers (estimated value $20,000)
- **Auction proceeds**: $18,000
- **Distribution**:
  - Bailiff fees: $2,000
  - Rent arrears: $15,000
  - **Surplus to tenant**: $1,000

### Tenant Redemption Rights (Payment Before Sale)

**Right to redeem** (s.21):
- Tenant may pay full arrears + bailiff fees **before sale** to stop distress and reclaim goods
- **Payment deadline**: Before auctioneer's hammer falls (literally - once sold, too late)

**Redemption amount**:
- **Rent arrears**: Full amount owing (cannot pay partial)
- **Bailiff costs**: Seizure, storage, advertising fees to date
- **Future rent**: If landlord demands, tenant must pay upcoming rent to redeem (optional landlord requirement)

**Example**:
- **Arrears**: $10,000
- **Bailiff costs**: $1,500
- **Redemption**: Tenant pays $11,500 on day before auction → distress ends, goods returned

### Liability for Wrongful Distress (Damages, Conversion)

**Wrongful distress**: Distress conducted improperly (seize exempt goods, unlawful entry, seize third-party property)

**Tenant's remedies**:
- **Damages**: Compensation for losses (business interruption, damaged goods, emotional distress)
- **Return of goods**: Court order requiring immediate return
- **Punitive damages**: If landlord acted in bad faith

**Examples of wrongful distress**:
- Seizing goods worth $50,000 for $5,000 arrears (excessive seizure)
- Seizing tools of trade exceeding $2,000 exemption
- Forcible entry (breaking locks) when tenant absent

**Liability exposure**: Landlords often avoid distress due to wrongful distress risk - prefer litigation

## Re-Entry and Lease Termination (s.20)

Landlord's right to terminate lease and repossess premises for tenant breach.

### Peaceable Re-Entry Requirements (No Force, No Breach of Peace)

**Peaceable re-entry** (common law + s.23):
- Landlord may re-enter premises and change locks **if no force used**
- **Peaceable**: No breaking doors, no confrontation with tenant, no violence

**Lawful methods**:
- **Tenant vacates**: Landlord changes locks after tenant leaves
- **Key handover**: Tenant surrenders keys voluntarily
- **Locksmith during absence**: Change locks when premises unoccupied (business closed, tenant away)

**Unlawful methods** (breach of peace):
- Breaking down doors while tenant inside
- Confronting tenant, forcibly evicting
- Changing locks while tenant inside (traps tenant)

**Consequences of unlawful re-entry**:
- **Trespass**: Tenant can sue for trespass, damages
- **Injunction**: Court orders landlord to restore tenant's access
- **Lease reinstated**: Unlawful re-entry may void termination

**Safer alternative**: Court application for possession (obtain order, sheriff enforces)

### Lock Change Procedures (Notice to Tenant, Property Storage)

**Notice of termination**:
- Landlord must first terminate lease (notice of termination for default)
- **CTA does not specify notice period** - lease typically specifies (e.g., 5 days for rent default, 15 days for covenant breach)

**Lock change**:
- After termination effective and tenant fails to vacate, landlord may change locks
- **Best practice**: Notify tenant of lock change (avoid tenant arriving to locked premises and calling police)

**Tenant's property**:
- **Duty to preserve**: Landlord must store tenant's goods safely (cannot dispose immediately)
- **Storage period**: Reasonable period for tenant to reclaim (30-60 days typical)
- **Storage costs**: Landlord may charge tenant for storage

**Example**:
- **Termination notice**: 10 days for non-payment of rent
- **Tenant fails to pay**: Lease terminates, tenant does not vacate
- **Re-entry**: Landlord changes locks when premises empty (evening after business hours)
- **Tenant's goods**: Moved to storage locker, tenant notified (30 days to reclaim, then landlord may sell)

### Acceleration of Rent (Entire Term vs. Duty to Mitigate)

**Acceleration clause** (common in commercial leases):
- "Upon default, all rent for remainder of term immediately due and payable"
- **Example**: 5-year lease, 2 years remaining, $5,000/month = $120,000 accelerated

**Enforceability**:
- **Valid clause**: Acceleration clauses enforceable in Ontario (not penalty)
- **But**: Subject to duty to mitigate (landlord must attempt to re-lease)

**Duty to mitigate** (*Southcott Estates Inc. v. Toronto Catholic District School Board*, 2012):
- Landlord cannot sit idle and collect accelerated rent
- Must make reasonable efforts to re-lease premises
- **Reasonable efforts**: Market property, accept suitable replacement tenant, negotiate in good faith

**Damages calculation** (with mitigation):
- **Accelerated rent**: $120,000 (2 years × $5,000/month)
- **Mitigation**: Landlord re-leases to new tenant at $4,500/month after 6 months
- **Landlord's damages**: 6 months × $5,000 (vacancy) + 18 months × $500 (rent differential) = $30,000 + $9,000 = **$39,000**
- **NOT**: Full $120,000 (duty to mitigate reduces damages)

### Tenant's Right to Relief from Forfeiture (Court Discretion)

**Relief from forfeiture**: Court may reinstate lease despite landlord's termination

**Jurisdiction**: Superior Court (inherent equitable jurisdiction)

**Discretion**: Court considers:
- **Breach severity**: Minor vs. serious breach (one-time late payment vs. chronic default)
- **Tenant's conduct**: Good faith (inadvertent breach) vs. willful (deliberate non-payment)
- **Prejudice to landlord**: Can landlord be compensated by damages (pay arrears + interest)?
- **Hardship to tenant**: Business failure if evicted vs. can relocate easily

**Typical relief**: Tenant pays all arrears + landlord's legal costs + interest, lease reinstated

**Example**:
- **Breach**: Tenant 15 days late on $10,000 rent payment (bank error, not willful)
- **Landlord action**: Terminates lease, re-enters premises
- **Tenant applies**: Relief from forfeiture
- **Court decision**: Grants relief (minor breach, tenant pays $10,000 + interest + $5,000 legal costs, lease continues)

**Limits on relief**:
- **Repeat defaults**: Relief rarely granted if tenant has history of defaults (chronic late payer)
- **Serious breaches**: Illegal use, damage to premises → relief less likely

## Overholding Tenant Liability (s.23)

Tenant who remains in possession after lease expiry without landlord consent.

### Double Rent Obligation (2x Market Rent)

**s.23(1)**: "A tenant holding over after the termination of a tenancy is liable to pay to the landlord double the yearly value of the land so occupied for the time that the tenant continues in occupation."

**Calculation**:
- **Market rent**: Current market rent (not expired lease rent)
- **Double**: 2 × market rent
- **Period**: Days of holdover

**Example**:
- **Lease rent**: $8,000/month (expired lease)
- **Market rent**: $10,000/month (current market)
- **Holdover period**: 45 days (1.5 months)
- **Liability**: 1.5 months × $10,000/month × 2 = **$30,000** double rent

**Purpose**: Deter holdovers, compensate landlord for inability to deliver to new tenant

### Damages Beyond Double Rent (Loss of Incoming Tenant)

**Additional damages** (if landlord proves actual loss exceeds double rent):
- **Lost incoming tenant**: Landlord had replacement tenant ready to move in, lost deal due to holdover
- **Legal fees**: Eviction costs
- **Lost rent differential**: New tenant would pay higher rent than old tenant (lost premium rent)

**Example**:
- **Double rent**: $30,000 (calculated above)
- **Incoming tenant**: New tenant agreed to $12,000/month lease (3-year term), but withdrew due to delayed possession
- **Lost value**: ($12,000 - $10,000) × 36 months = **$72,000** (premium rent lost)
- **Total damages**: $30,000 (double rent) + $72,000 (lost premium) + $8,000 (legal fees) = **$110,000**

**Burden of proof**: Landlord must prove actual damages beyond double rent (show incoming tenant deal, withdrawal notice)

### Exceptions (Holdover with Landlord Consent, Good Faith Disputes)

**Implied consent**: Landlord accepts rent after lease expiry → creates month-to-month tenancy (not holdover)
- **Example**: Lease expires May 31, tenant remains, pays June rent, landlord accepts → month-to-month tenancy

**Good faith dispute**: Tenant reasonably believes entitled to remain (lease ambiguity, renewal option dispute)
- **Example**: Tenant believes they exercised renewal option properly, landlord disagrees → good faith dispute, double rent may not apply

**Landlord delay**: If landlord delays delivering possession to incoming tenant (not tenant's fault), holdover damages reduced

## Case Law on Remedy Selection

### Distress vs. Termination (Cannot Pursue Both Simultaneously)

**Election doctrine**: Landlord must choose between distress (affirms lease) or termination (ends lease)

**Cannot do both**:
- Distress affirms lease (landlord treats lease as continuing)
- Termination ends lease (landlord treats lease as breached, terminated)
- **Inconsistent**: Cannot affirm and terminate simultaneously

**Election required**:
- **Choose distress**: Landlord seizes goods for arrears → lease continues, tenant remains liable for future rent
- **Choose termination**: Landlord terminates lease, re-enters → lease ends, tenant not liable for future rent (only damages to lease end)

**Example**:
- **Arrears**: $20,000 (4 months × $5,000)
- **Landlord actions**: (1) Seizes tenant's goods via distress on June 1, (2) Terminates lease and re-enters on June 15
- **Problem**: Election doctrine violated (distress affirms, termination ends - inconsistent)
- **Result**: Tenant argues termination invalid (landlord already elected distress by seizing goods)

### Election Doctrine (*Highway Properties Ltd. v. Kelly, Douglas & Co.*)

**Facts**: Landlord re-entered premises after tenant default, claimed accelerated rent for remainder of term

**Holding**: Landlord elected to terminate lease by re-entry → cannot claim future rent (lease terminated)
- **Alternative**: Landlord could have kept lease alive, sued for rent as it came due month-by-month

**Principle**: Termination ends both parties' obligations (except damages to termination date)

**Damages post-termination**:
- Rent arrears to termination date
- **Future loss**: Difference between lease rent and mitigation rent (if re-leases at lower rate)
- **Not**: Future rent under terminated lease (lease no longer exists)

### Mitigation Duty (*Southcott Estates Inc. v. Toronto Catholic District School Board*)

**Facts**: School board tenant vacated 10 years early, landlord sued for $3.8M accelerated rent, made minimal effort to re-lease

**Holding**: Landlord has duty to mitigate - cannot sit idle collecting rent from departed tenant
- **Requirement**: Reasonable efforts to re-lease (market property, accept suitable tenant, negotiate reasonably)
- **Damages reduced**: From $3.8M claimed to $1.1M (accounting for landlord's failure to mitigate)

**Reasonable efforts**:
- List property with broker
- Advertise at market rent (not inflated)
- Accept creditworthy replacement tenant (cannot hold out for perfect tenant)
- Negotiate in good faith (cannot reject reasonable offers to maximize damages)

**Unreasonable**:
- Refusing to show property
- Demanding above-market rent
- Rejecting suitable tenants
- Failing to advertise
