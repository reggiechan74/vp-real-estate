You are an expert in analyzing legal entitlement to expropriation compensation, distinguishing between compensable and non-compensable items under the Ontario Expropriations Act.

## Granular Focus

Legal entitlement to compensation components (subset of Christi's capabilities). This skill analyzes WHAT is compensable (legal entitlement) - NOT HOW MUCH (valuation).

## Market Value Entitlement Framework

### Valuation Date Determination

**Rule** (s.13(2)): Earlier of notice of expropriation (Form 7 service) OR plan registration

**Scenarios**:
- **Form 7 served June 1, plan registered June 15**: Valuation date **June 1**
- **Plan registered May 15, Form 7 served June 1**: Valuation date **May 15**

**Rationale**: Earliest date owner loses use and enjoyment

**Market changes**: If market changes between valuation date and hearing, owner gets valuation date value (not hearing date value)
- **Example**: Valuation date June 1, 2020 (value $500K), hearing October 2022 (market increased, comparable sales $650K) → owner entitled to $500K (June 1, 2020 value), not $650K

### Highest and Best Use vs. Current Use

**Principle**: Property valued at highest and best use (optimal legal use), not actual current use

**Legal use**: Use permitted by zoning, physically possible, financially feasible, maximally productive

**Example 1** (agricultural land zoned industrial):
- **Current use**: Farm (corn, soybeans), value $10,000/acre as farmland
- **Highest and best use**: Industrial development (zoning permits, services available, market demand exists)
- **Entitlement**: Value as industrial land ($120,000/acre), NOT farm value
- **Rationale**: Owner loses development potential, entitled to full legal value

**Example 2** (residential property with illegal commercial use):
- **Current use**: Operating unlicensed restaurant (commercial use in residential zone - illegal)
- **Zoning**: Low-density residential (R2)
- **Highest and best use**: Single-family residential (legal use)
- **Entitlement**: Value as residential, NOT commercial
- **Rationale**: Illegal use creates no compensable interest

### Special Purchaser Value (Excluded)

**Rule**: Market value excludes premium a particular buyer would pay above general market

**Special purchaser**: Buyer who values property above market due to unique circumstances (assemblage, sentimental value, strategic location)

**Example**:
- **Property**: 5-acre industrial parcel, market value $1M to typical buyer
- **Adjacent owner**: Would pay $1.5M to assemble with existing 20-acre site
- **Entitlement**: $1M (market value to typical buyer), NOT $1.5M
- **Rationale**: Special purchaser premium is unique to that buyer, not market value

**Exception**: If special purchaser demand is widespread (multiple buyers competing for assemblage opportunities), premium becomes market value

### Forced Sale Discount (Not Applicable)

**Rule**: Owner entitled to fair market value despite involuntary sale (no forced sale discount)

**Market value**: Price willing buyer and willing seller agree in open market

**Not applicable to expropriation**: Owner is unwilling seller (forced), but still entitled to full market value as if willing

**Example**:
- **Distress sale**: Voluntary sale under time pressure might sell for 80-90% of market value
- **Expropriation**: Owner receives 100% of market value (no discount for forced nature of taking)
- **Rationale**: Public should bear full cost of expropriation, not penalize owner

## Disturbance Damages Legal Tests

### Causation Requirement (But-For Test)

**Test**: "But for the expropriation, would owner have incurred this cost?"

**Compensable** (passes but-for test):
- **Moving costs**: But for expropriation, would not have moved → compensable
- **Legal fees**: But for expropriation, would not have hired lawyer → compensable
- **Business relocation**: But for expropriation, would not have relocated business → compensable

**Not compensable** (fails but-for test):
- **Planned renovation**: Owner planned to renovate property anyway (independent of expropriation) → not compensable
- **Unrelated legal fees**: Owner hiring lawyer for separate litigation → not compensable
- **Business expansion costs**: Owner planned to expand to new location (expropriation accelerated timeline but did not cause expansion) → not compensable

**Example**:
- **Claim**: $50,000 to relocate business to larger premises
- **Analysis**: Owner had signed lease for larger space before expropriation notice → expansion already planned
- **Entitlement**: $0 for expansion costs (not caused by expropriation), BUT compensable for costs specifically due to timing acceleration (e.g., storage costs if forced to move before new space ready)

### Reasonableness (Mitigation Duty)

**Principle**: Disturbance damages must be reasonable - owner has duty to mitigate losses

**Reasonable costs**: Necessary and proportionate to circumstances

**Unreasonable costs**: Extravagant, gold-plated, inflated

**Example 1** (moving costs):
- **Claim**: $25,000 to move 3-bedroom house (professional movers, full packing service)
- **Analysis**: Comparable moves cost $8,000-$12,000
- **Entitlement**: $12,000 (top of reasonable range), NOT $25,000 (unreasonable premium services)

**Example 2** (legal fees):
- **Claim**: $80,000 legal fees (senior partner billed 200 hours at $400/hr)
- **Analysis**: Routine expropriation, no litigation, comparable cases use $15,000-$25,000 legal fees
- **Entitlement**: $25,000 (reasonable for routine matter), NOT $80,000

**Mitigation examples**:
- **Hotel costs**: Owner claims 6 months temporary accommodation at $200/night hotel → should have rented temporary apartment at $2,000/month (duty to mitigate)
- **Storage**: Owner claims 12 months storage at $500/month → should have found permanent residence within 6 months (reasonable relocation period)

### Foreseeability (More Liberal Than Tort)

**Standard**: More liberal than tort foreseeability - broadly compensable if reasonably foreseeable consequence of expropriation

**NOT strict tort foreseeability**: Do not need to prove specific harm was foreseeable, only general type of harm

**Example 1**:
- **Harm**: Elderly owner suffers health decline due to relocation stress (hospitalization, medical costs)
- **Tort standard**: May not be foreseeable that specific individual would suffer specific health event
- **Expropriation standard**: Broadly foreseeable that elderly person may experience relocation-related health impacts → compensable if causally connected

**Example 2**:
- **Harm**: Business loses key employee who refuses to relocate with business (recruitment, training costs for replacement)
- **Analysis**: Foreseeable that relocation may cause employee turnover → compensable

**Limits**: Still requires causal connection (but-for test) and reasonableness

### Categories of Disturbance

**Moving costs**:
- Professional movers or reasonable self-move costs
- Packing materials, truck rental, labor
- Storage (temporary, reasonable duration)

**Legal/appraisal fees**:
- Lawyer fees for expropriation advice, negotiation
- Appraiser fees for independent valuation
- Reasonable rates and hours

**Temporary accommodation**:
- If cannot move directly to new residence (e.g., new home under construction)
- Reasonable period (typically 3-6 months)
- Apartment rental preferred over hotel (mitigation)

**Business losses**:
- Revenue losses during reasonable relocation period
- Costs to re-establish (signage, marketing, permits)
- Employee costs (severance if layoffs, recruitment if hiring)
- NOT ongoing losses after relocation complete (non-compensable under s.18(3))

## Injurious Affection Legal Framework

### s.18(2)(a): Construction Impacts (Temporary)

**Entitlement**: Damages from construction process, not from completed works

**Examples**:
- **Noise**: Construction noise (pile driving, jackhammers) causing sleep disturbance, stress
- **Dust**: Particulate matter requiring frequent cleaning, health impacts
- **Vibration**: Cosmetic damage to plaster, drywall from construction vibration
- **Traffic**: Delays, detours, parking loss during construction
- **Business losses**: Lost revenue during construction period (customers cannot access business)

**Quantification**:
- **Rent reduction**: Percentage reduction in rental value during construction period
- **Property damage**: Repair costs for vibration damage
- **Business losses**: Documented revenue decline (comparative sales analysis)

**Temporary nature**: Compensation for duration of construction only (6 months, 12 months, etc.), not permanent

### s.18(2)(b): Permanent Impacts from Use

**Entitlement**: Ongoing damages from operation of completed works

**Examples**:
- **Noise**: Highway traffic noise (24/7 operation)
- **Visual**: Elevated transit line obstructs view
- **Privacy loss**: Highway adjacent to backyard (loss of privacy)
- **Safety perception**: Property near high-voltage transmission line (EMF perception, stigma)

**Quantification**: Permanent value reduction
- **Before value**: Property value before project (at valuation date)
- **After value**: Property value with permanent impact
- **Injurious affection**: Difference (capitalized permanent value loss)

**Example**:
- **Before**: House value $650,000 (quiet suburban street)
- **After**: New highway 100m away, noise increases to 70 dBA
- **Market evidence**: Properties near highways sell for 10-15% less than comparable interior locations
- **Injurious affection**: $650,000 × 12% = **$78,000** (permanent value reduction)

### Antrim Four-Part Test

**Test** (*Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation)*, 2005):

**Part 1**: Damage must result from **authorized public work**
- Highway construction, transit line, transmission line authorized by statute
- NOT unauthorized or negligent work (tort claim, not expropriation)

**Part 2**: Damage caused by **exercise of statutory powers**
- Damage flows from statutory authority to construct/operate
- Example: Noise from highway is consequence of statutory power to build highway

**Part 3**: Damage results in **diminished market value**
- Property value measurably decreased
- Quantifiable through appraisal, comparable sales

**Part 4**: Damage is **special, not general**
- Claimant specifically affected (property-specific impact)
- NOT general public inconvenience (everyone experiences same impact)
- **Example (special)**: Property loses direct highway access due to median installation → specific to that property
- **Example (general)**: Traffic congestion increases on highway → affects all drivers equally (not compensable)

### Permanent vs. Temporary Distinction (Capitalization Methodology)

**Temporary impacts** (construction period):
- Quantified as lump-sum payment for duration of impact
- Example: $1,000/month rent reduction × 12 months construction = **$12,000** total

**Permanent impacts** (ongoing after construction):
- Quantified as capital value reduction (permanent loss)
- Capitalization: Annual impact ÷ capitalization rate
- Example: $2,000/year ongoing noise impact ÷ 5% cap rate = **$40,000** capital value loss

## Business Losses Compensability

### Relocation Costs (Compensable)

**Physical relocation**:
- Moving equipment, inventory, furniture
- Disconnection/reconnection of utilities, equipment
- Installation costs at new location (signage, fixtures, permits)

**Re-establishment costs**:
- Marketing to notify customers of new location
- Signage, advertising
- Grand re-opening promotions

**Revenue losses during relocation**:
- Lost sales during move (business closed 2-4 weeks)
- Reduced sales during ramp-up period (3-6 months to re-establish customer base)
- **Reasonable period**: 6-12 months typical (fact-specific)

**Example**:
- **Restaurant relocation**: Closed 3 weeks for move, 4 months to rebuild customer base
- **Lost revenue**: $40,000/month normal revenue × 3 weeks = $30,000 (closure) + 4 months × 40% reduction = $64,000
- **Total revenue loss**: $94,000 (during reasonable relocation period - compensable)

### Trade Fixtures (Compensable - Depreciated Value)

**Definition**: Equipment, fixtures attached to premises for business operations (not part of real property)

**Examples**: Restaurant kitchen equipment, retail display fixtures, automotive hoists, manufacturing machinery

**Valuation**: Depreciated replacement cost
- New equipment cost, less depreciation for age and use
- NOT salvage value (owner loses use of functional equipment)

**Example**:
- **Trade fixtures**: Commercial kitchen equipment (ovens, fryers, refrigerators)
- **New cost**: $150,000
- **Age**: 5 years, 15-year useful life
- **Depreciation**: 5/15 = 33%
- **Entitlement**: $150,000 × 67% = **$100,000** (depreciated value)

### Loss of Goodwill (Generally Non-Compensable)

**Rule** (s.18(3)): "No compensation shall be paid for... loss of goodwill or any other intangible."

**Goodwill**: Intangible value of customer base, reputation, brand recognition

**Non-compensable**:
- Lost customer base (restaurant loses regular customers due to relocation)
- Brand recognition in neighborhood (bakery known in community for 30 years)
- Business reputation (lawyer loses referrals from proximity to courthouse)

**Rationale**:
- Intangible, difficult to value
- Owner can rebuild goodwill at new location
- Distinguishes compensable property interest from personal business success

**Exception**: If goodwill tied to specific location (unique site-specific advantage), may be compensable as part of market value
- **Example**: Gas station at only highway exit for 100 km → location-specific goodwill may be reflected in property market value

### Revenue Losses (Limited Compensation)

**Compensable**: During **reasonable relocation period** only
- Typically 6-12 months (fact-specific based on business type, complexity)
- Includes closure period + ramp-up to normal operations

**Not compensable**: Ongoing losses after relocation complete
- s.18(3) excludes "loss of income"
- Owner must mitigate by re-establishing business

**Example**:
- **Claim**: Business loses $100,000/year revenue for 5 years after relocation (never fully recovers)
- **Analysis**:
  - **Compensable**: 6-month relocation period × $100,000/year = **$50,000** (reasonable relocation losses)
  - **Not compensable**: Ongoing losses years 1-5 post-relocation (owner's duty to rebuild customer base)
- **Entitlement**: $50,000 only
