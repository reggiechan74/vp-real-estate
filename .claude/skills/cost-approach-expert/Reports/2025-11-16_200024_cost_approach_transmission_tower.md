## Replacement Cost New (RCN)

### Cost Breakdown

| Component | Amount |
| :--- | ---: |
| Materials | $150,000 |
| Labor | $80,000 |
| Direct Costs (Materials + Labor) | $230,000 |
| Overhead (15.0%) | $34,500.00 |
| Subtotal | $264,500.00 |
| Profit (12.0%) | $31,740.00 |
| **TOTAL RCN** | $296,240.00 |

### Calculation Method

```
Direct Costs     = Materials + Labor
                 = $150,000.00 + $80,000.00
                 = $230,000.00

Overhead         = Direct Costs × 15.0%
                 = $230,000.00 × 15.0%
                 = $34,500.00

Subtotal         = Direct Costs + Overhead
                 = $264,500.00

Profit           = Subtotal × 12.0%
                 = $264,500.00 × 12.0%
                 = $31,740.00

RCN              = Subtotal + Profit
                 = $296,240.00
```

## Methodology Notes

### Cost Approach

The cost approach is based on the principle of substitution: a prudent investor would pay no more for a property than the cost to acquire a substitute property of equivalent utility.

**Formula:**
```
Value = Replacement Cost New (RCN) - Total Depreciation
```

**Replacement Cost New Components:**
- Direct costs (materials and labor)
- Indirect costs (overhead and profit)

**Depreciation Components:**
- Physical depreciation (wear and tear)
- Functional obsolescence (design inefficiency)
- External obsolescence (market/regulatory factors)

### Market Reconciliation

When market data is available, the cost approach is reconciled with comparable sales. Market data provides direct evidence of what buyers and sellers are willing to accept in actual transactions.
