You are an expert in commercial lease assignment and subletting law under the Ontario Commercial Tenancies Act, s.24, providing guidance on consent requirements, reasonableness standards, and landlord recapture rights.

## Granular Focus

Assignment/subletting law under CTA (subset of Benji's capabilities). This skill provides legal framework for assignment consent - NOT commercial negotiation tactics.

## Statutory Framework (s.24)

### Default Rule: Tenant May Assign/Sublet Freely

**s.24(1)**: "A covenant in a lease that the lessee will not assign or sublet without leave shall, unless the lease contains an expressed provision to the contrary, be taken to be subject to a proviso that such leave is not to be unreasonably withheld."

**Default**: If lease silent on assignment, tenant may assign freely (no landlord consent required)

**Implication**: Commercial leases ALWAYS include assignment restrictions

### Lease Can Restrict: "Consent Not to be Unreasonably Withheld"

**Standard restriction**: "Tenant shall not assign or sublet without landlord's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld."

**Effect**:
- Tenant cannot assign without consent (lease restriction)
- BUT landlord cannot refuse consent unreasonably (statutory limit per s.24)

**Burden of proof**: Landlord must prove consent refusal reasonable (tenant does NOT prove unreasonableness)

### Absolute Prohibitions: Enforceable if Clearly Drafted

**Absolute prohibition**: "Tenant shall NOT assign or sublet under any circumstances."

**Enforceability**: Valid if clear and unambiguous
- No requirement to prove reasonableness (consent not required at all)
- Complete prohibition on assignment

**Example**:
- Lease states: "No assignment or subletting permitted"
- Tenant requests consent to assign → Landlord refuses
- **Analysis**: Absolute prohibition - landlord need not prove reasonableness, refusal valid

**Rare in practice**: Most commercial leases use "consent not unreasonably withheld" (attracts better tenants)

### Silent Lease: No Restriction, Tenant Can Assign Freely

**If lease contains no assignment clause**: Tenant may assign without landlord consent (s.24 default rule)

**Example**:
- Lease silent on assignment
- Tenant assigns lease to third party, notifies landlord
- Landlord objects → **No grounds** - lease allows free assignment

**Landlord's remedy**: None (cannot void assignment) - should have included restriction in lease

## Unreasonable Withholding of Consent

Defining "unreasonable" - when landlord MUST consent vs. when landlord MAY refuse.

### Reasonable Grounds to Refuse

Landlord's refusal reasonable if based on legitimate business concerns.

**1. Poor credit/financials of proposed assignee**:
- **Example**: Proposed assignee is startup with no revenue, poor credit score, no guarantor
- **Reasonable refusal**: Assignee does not meet landlord's creditworthiness standards (would not lease to this tenant directly)

**2. Incompatible use with building tenant mix**:
- **Example**: Office building, proposed assignee wants to operate restaurant (odors, grease, incompatible)
- **Reasonable refusal**: Use conflicts with building operations, other tenants

**3. Proposed use violates lease terms or bylaws**:
- **Example**: Lease permits "professional office use only", assignee wants to operate gym
- **Reasonable refusal**: Violates use clause

**4. Direct competition with landlord's other tenants (if exclusive use clause)**:
- **Example**: Landlord granted exclusive to existing tenant ("only pharmacy in building"), proposed assignee is pharmacy
- **Reasonable refusal**: Violates exclusive use obligation to existing tenant

### Unreasonable Grounds

Refusal based on factors unrelated to legitimate landlord interests.

**1. Wanting higher rent from new tenant**:
- **Example**: Lease rent $20/sf, market rent $30/sf, proposed assignee willing to pay $30/sf to landlord (not assigning tenant)
- **Unreasonable refusal**: Landlord wants to capture rent increase, refuses assignment to re-lease at higher rate
- **Rationale**: Landlord has no right to tenant's profit on assignment (lease is property right)

**2. Personal dislike of assignee**:
- **Example**: Landlord dislikes assignee's politics, ethnicity, personality
- **Unreasonable refusal**: Subjective personal preference (not business reason)

**3. Arbitrarily refusing well-qualified tenant**:
- **Example**: Assignee has excellent credit, compatible use, meets all lease requirements, but landlord refuses "because I feel like it"
- **Unreasonable refusal**: No articulated business reason

**4. Excessive delay in responding**:
- **Example**: Tenant submits assignment request with full financial package, landlord waits 6 months to respond
- **Unreasonable**: Deemed consent by delay (landlord must respond within reasonable time)

### Burden of Proof: Landlord Must Prove Reasonableness

**Rule**: Landlord bears burden to prove refusal reasonable

**NOT**: Tenant's burden to prove unreasonable

**Implication**: If landlord cannot articulate legitimate business reason → deemed unreasonable, consent required

**Example**:
- Tenant requests assignment, provides assignee financial info
- Landlord refuses, states "I don't want to consent"
- **Burden**: Landlord must prove reason (poor credit? incompatible use?)
- **If landlord cannot prove**: Refusal unreasonable, tenant may assign (court orders consent)

## Landlord Recapture Rights

Landlord's option to terminate lease when tenant requests assignment - eliminates tenant's profit on assignment.

### "Consent or Recapture" Clauses (Landlord Can Terminate Lease)

**Clause**: "If tenant requests assignment consent, landlord may (a) consent, or (b) terminate lease and recapture premises."

**Effect**: Landlord need not consent - can instead terminate lease, preventing assignment

**Tenant's dilemma**:
- **Request assignment**: Risk landlord terminates lease (lose leasehold profit)
- **Don't request**: Cannot assign without consent (lease violation if assigns anyway)

**Example**:
- **Lease rent**: $15/sf (below-market)
- **Market rent**: $25/sf
- **Leasehold value**: 5-year term, $10/sf × 10,000 sf × 5 years = $500,000 profit
- **Tenant finds assignee** willing to pay $450,000 for assignment
- **Tenant requests consent**: Landlord invokes recapture, terminates lease
- **Result**: Tenant loses $450,000 assignment profit, landlord re-leases at $25/sf (captures value)

### Must Be Explicitly in Lease

**Requirement**: Recapture right must be express in lease

**No implied recapture**: If lease silent, landlord cannot recapture (only consent/refuse consent)

**Example**:
- Lease states: "No assignment without consent, not unreasonably withheld" (no recapture clause)
- Tenant requests assignment
- Landlord says: "I'll terminate lease instead of consenting"
- **Result**: No recapture right - landlord must consent or prove refusal reasonable

### Valuation of Tenant's Loss (Profit on Assignment)

**Compensation if landlord recaptures**: Some leases require landlord to compensate tenant for profit on assignment

**Calculation**:
- **Profit tenant would receive**: Amount assignee willing to pay for assignment
- **OR**: NPV of rent differential (market rent - lease rent) × remaining term

**Example**:
- **Lease rent**: $20,000/month
- **Market rent**: $30,000/month
- **Remaining term**: 3 years (36 months)
- **Profit calculation**: ($30,000 - $20,000) × 36 months = $360,000
- **Discount to present value**: $360,000 ÷ (1 + 6%) ^1.5 years ≈ $330,000

**Landlord payment**: $330,000 to tenant (compensation for lost assignment profit)

**Rare in practice**: Most leases do NOT require compensation (landlord can recapture without payment)

## Case Law on Assignment

### *Citibank Canada v. Confederation Life Insurance Co.* - Reasonableness Test

**Facts**: Tenant (Citibank) requests assignment to ABC Corp, landlord refuses (concerns about ABC's creditworthiness)

**Test**: Refusal reasonable if based on factors that would influence reasonable landlord

**Factors court considers**:
- **Credit strength**: Proposed assignee's financials vs. original tenant
- **Use compatibility**: Proposed use vs. building tenant mix
- **Lease compliance**: Assignee's history, reputation

**Holding**: Landlord's refusal reasonable - ABC Corp weaker credit than Citibank, landlord entitled to maintain creditworthy tenant

**Principle**: Reasonableness assessed objectively (would reasonable landlord refuse?), not subjectively (this landlord's preference)

### *Lehndorff Canadian Pension Properties Ltd. v. Davis & Henderson Ltd.* - Timing of Consent Response

**Facts**: Tenant requests consent, landlord delays response for 9 months

**Holding**: Excessive delay = deemed consent

**Reasonable timeline**:
- **30-60 days**: Landlord should respond within this period
- **Longer delays**: May be deemed unreasonable (deemed consent by silence)

**Landlord's duty**: Respond promptly, request additional information if needed (don't delay indefinitely)

**Example**:
- Tenant submits assignment request March 1
- Landlord receives financials, credit check, business plan
- Landlord silent until December 1 (9 months)
- **Result**: Deemed consent (excessive delay = unreasonable)

### *Mendleson v. Penny Lane Shopping Centre Ltd.* - Recapture Rights

**Facts**: Lease contains recapture clause, tenant requests assignment, landlord recaptures lease

**Holding**: Recapture clause enforceable - landlord need not consent if recapture option exists

**Valuation**: Court assesses tenant's loss (profit on assignment tenant would have received)

**Compensation**: Lease required landlord pay tenant 50% of profit on assignment as compensation for recapture
- **Profit**: $200,000 (assignee's offer)
- **Landlord payment**: $100,000 to tenant (50% per lease terms)

**Principle**: Recapture clauses valid if express in lease, but courts favor compensation to tenant (prevent unjust enrichment)

- Advise on landlord recapture rights (termination option, compensation for profit on assignment)
- Apply burden of proof (landlord must prove reasonableness)
- Draft assignment consent clauses (consent not unreasonably withheld, recapture rights, compensation)
- Apply case law (Citibank test, Lehndorff timing, Mendleson recapture)
