## Core Expertise

### Fundamental Concepts

**1. Assignment vs. Sublease**:

**Assignment**:
- **Definition**: Transfer of tenant's entire interest in the lease to a third party (assignee)
- **Effect**: Assignee steps into tenant's shoes as direct tenant under lease
- **Privity of Estate**: Created between landlord and assignee
- **Privity of Contract**: Original tenant remains in privity of contract with landlord
- **Liability**: Original tenant remains secondarily liable; assignee becomes primarily liable
- **Relationship**: Assignee has direct relationship with landlord

**Sublease**:
- **Definition**: Tenant (sublandlord) grants a lesser interest to subtenant
- **Lesser Interest**: Shorter term, smaller space, or subject to master lease
- **No Direct Relationship**: Subtenant has no privity with landlord (unless agreement provides)
- **Liability**: Tenant remains primarily liable to landlord; subtenant liable only to tenant
- **Layer**: Creates "sandwich" lease (landlord → tenant → subtenant)

**Key Distinction**:
```
Assignment: Transfer of ENTIRE interest
    Original Lease: Landlord → Tenant (Term: 10 years)
    After Assignment: Landlord → Assignee (remaining 7 years)
    Original Tenant: Remains secondarily liable

Sublease: Transfer of LESS than entire interest
    Original Lease: Landlord → Tenant (Term: 10 years remaining)
    Sublease: Tenant → Subtenant (Term: 5 years)
    Tenant: Retains reversion (5 years), primarily liable to Landlord
```

**Test for Assignment vs. Sublease**:
- **Intent**: What did parties intend?
- **Reversion**: Did tenant retain any reversion? (If yes → sublease)
- **Term**: Is sublease term less than lease term? (Usually → sublease)
- **Rent**: Is subrent different from lease rent? (May indicate sublease)

**2. Why Landlord Consent is Required**:

**Lease Covenant**:
- Standard lease provision: Tenant shall not assign or sublet without landlord's prior written consent
- Protects landlord's interests in property and rent stream
- Allows landlord to control who occupies premises

**Legal Standard**:
- "Landlord's consent not to be unreasonably withheld" (common law or statute)
- Landlord must act reasonably but has legitimate interests
- Cannot refuse arbitrarily or capriciously

**Landlord's Legitimate Concerns**:
1. **Credit**: Is assignee/subtenant financially strong enough?
2. **Use**: Will use be compatible with property and other tenants?
3. **Reputation**: Will assignee/subtenant harm property's reputation?
4. **Operations**: Will assignee/subtenant be responsible operator?
5. **Legal**: Any legal issues (litigation history, regulatory problems)?

**When Consent Can Be Withheld**:
- Assignee has poor credit or financial instability
- Proposed use incompatible or prohibited by lease/zoning
- Assignee is competitor of landlord
- Would increase landlord's operating costs or risks
- Would violate exclusivity clauses with other tenants
- Assignee's business model illegal or objectionable

**When Consent Cannot Be Withheld** (Unreasonable):
- Purely personal dislike of assignee
- To extract higher rent or unreasonable concessions
- Assignee is same credit quality and suitable use
- No legitimate business reason

**3. Landlord's Options Upon Request**:

When tenant requests consent to assign or sublet, landlord typically has three options:

**Option 1: Consent**:
- Approve the assignment/sublease
- Impose conditions (consent fee, continued liability)
- Enter into consent agreement

**Option 2: Refuse**:
- Deny consent (must be on reasonable grounds)
- Provide reasons
- Risk of tenant challenge if unreasonable

**Option 3: Recapture**:
- Take back the space (terminate lease)
- Re-let to proposed assignee or other tenant
- Eliminates original tenant's liability
- Landlord gets fresh lease with new tenant

**Recapture Rights**:
```
"If Tenant requests consent to assign or sublet, Landlord may,
at its sole option, elect to terminate the Lease and recapture
the Premises, such termination to be effective [90] days after
Landlord's election."
```

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Tenant perspective**: Recapture is negative (loses lease rights)
- **Landlord perspective**: Recapture is positive if strong market or weak original tenant
- **Negotiation**: Tenant should negotiate to eliminate recapture in strong position

### Structure of Consent Agreements

**1. Parties**:

**Typical Parties** (Assignment):
1. **Tenant/Assignor**: Original tenant assigning the lease
2. **Assignee**: Party taking assignment of lease
3. **Landlord**: Consenting to assignment

**Typical Parties** (Sublease):
1. **Tenant/Sublandlord**: Original tenant subletting space
2. **Subtenant**: Party taking sublease
3. **Landlord**: Consenting to sublease

**Complex Transactions** (Assignment + Sublease):
1. **Tenant/Assignor**: Original tenant
2. **Assignee**: Takes assignment from tenant
3. **Subtenant**: Takes sublease from assignee
4. **Landlord**: Consents to both transactions

**Example**: Dental practice sale
- Original Tenant assigns lease to Holdco (Assignee)
- Holdco immediately subleases to Professional Corporation (Subtenant)
- Landlord consents to both in one agreement
- Structure driven by professional corporation requirements

**2. Recitals**:

**Purpose of Recitals**:
- Provide context and background
- Document chain of title/lease history
- Establish parties' understanding
- Aid in interpretation if dispute arises

**Typical Recitals Include**:
1. **Original Lease**: Date, parties, premises description, term, key terms
2. **Amendments**: All amendments, renewals, extensions (lease "history")
3. **Assignments**: Prior assignments (establish current tenant)
4. **Landlord Changes**: Transfers of building ownership
5. **Business Transaction**: Share sale, asset sale triggering assignment
6. **Defined Terms**: "Lease" means original lease as amended
7. **Consent Requirement**: Reference to lease provision requiring consent

**Sample Recital**:
```
"WHEREAS by a lease dated September 27, 2004 ("Original Lease"),
[Original Landlord] leased to [Original Tenant] certain premises
known as Suite 101 ("Premises"), containing a Rentable Area of
approximately 2,428 square feet, in the building municipally known
as 1 Concorde Gate, Toronto, Ontario ("Building"), for a term of
Ten (10) years and Six (6) months commencing September 1, 2004
and expiring February 28, 2015, on the terms and conditions more
particularly set forth therein;"
```

**3. Core Provisions**:

**A. Landlord's Consent (Section 1)**:

**Standard Language**:
```
"Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Landlord hereby consents
as of the Effective Date, to the assignment of the Lease by Tenant
to Assignee, it being understood that Landlord in granting this
consent does not thereby acknowledge or approve of, or agree to be
bound by any of the terms of the Assignment between Tenant and
Assignee, but is only consenting to the occurrence of the Assignment."
```

**Key Elements**:
- **Effective Date**: When assignment takes effect
- **Limited Consent**: Only to this transaction, not future transfers
- **No Acknowledgment**: Landlord not bound by separate assignment agreement terms
- **No Waiver**: Does not waive landlord's other rights

**B. Landlord's Rights Continue (Section 2)**:

**Standard Language**:
```
"This consent by Landlord is without prejudice to Landlord's rights
under the Lease and at law, and shall not be deemed to authorize any
further or other assignment of the Lease or subletting or parting
with or sharing possession of all or any part of the Premises."
```

**Purpose**:
- Preserves landlord's rights for future transfers
- Consent to THIS transaction only
- Future assignments/sublets require new consent
- No waiver of defaults or rights

**C. Covenants of Assignee (Section 3)**:

**Joint and Several Liability**:
```
"Assignee covenants and agrees that it, together with Tenant, shall
be jointly and severally bound by all provisions of the Lease and
liable to pay to Landlord, all sums of any kind whatsoever and
perform all obligations of any kind whatsoever which Tenant is
obliged to pay or perform under the Lease throughout the Term and
any renewal or extension thereof."
```

**Key Obligations**:
1. **Bound by Lease**: All terms, covenants, conditions
2. **Joint and Several**: Landlord can sue assignee OR tenant OR both
3. **All Amounts**: Rent, additional rent, operating costs, future adjustments
4. **Term**: Throughout remainder plus renewals
5. **Direct Liability**: Assignee is primarily liable (in privity of estate)

**Retroactive Charges**:
```
"including, without limitation, any charges billed after the date
hereof, which relate to amounts payable in respect of the Premises
pursuant to the Lease or otherwise which at the date hereof, either
had not yet been billed to Tenant or had been billed to Tenant on
an estimated basis subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease."
```

**Purpose**: Ensures assignee liable for operating cost adjustments, tax adjustments, etc., even if billed later for pre-assignment period

**Future Work**:
```
"If Landlord performs any Leasehold Improvements or other work or
services with respect to the Premises at the request or on behalf
of Assignee, all amounts payable to Landlord with respect to such
improvements, work or services shall be deemed to be Rent payable
under the Lease."
```

**Purpose**: Amendments between landlord and assignee become part of lease; original tenant remains liable

**D. Covenants of Tenant (Section 4)**:

**Continued Liability**:
```
"Tenant covenants and agrees with Landlord that it is not hereby
released from the performance of any of its obligations pursuant to
the Lease and remains liable, jointly and severally with Assignee,
for all of the obligations of Tenant under the Lease, notwithstanding
the Assignment."
```

**Critical Elements**:
1. **No Release**: Assignment does NOT release original tenant
2. **Joint and Several**: Tenant and assignee both fully liable
3. **Secondary Liability**: Tenant becomes guarantor in effect
4. **Throughout Term**: Including renewals and extensions

**Landlord May Amend with Assignee**:
```
"Landlord and Assignee may agree as between themselves to amend the
terms of the Lease, it being agreed that no such amendments shall
have the effect of releasing Tenant from any of its obligations
under the Lease, for which Tenant shall remain liable to the same
extent as if such amendments had not been made."
```

**Impact on Tenant**:
- Landlord can increase rent, change terms with assignee
- Original tenant remains liable for amended terms
- Very unfavorable to tenant
- Should be negotiated to limit amendments requiring tenant's consent

**Termination Does Not Release Tenant**:
```
"if Landlord terminates the Lease as a result of any default by
Assignee, such termination shall, as against Tenant, be without
prejudice to all the rights of Landlord under the Lease and at law,
including the right to obtain from Tenant all arrears of rent and
other charges owing under the Lease, up to the date of termination
and damages in respect of losses and deficiencies sustained by
Landlord."
```

**Bankruptcy/Insolvency**:
```
"if Assignee is released or discharged in any receivership, bankruptcy,
winding up or other creditors' proceeding or the Lease is disclaimed
in any such proceeding, the obligations of Tenant shall not thereby
be released, waived, impaired or affected but shall continue with
respect to the entire Term as if the Lease had not been disclaimed,
and, at the option of Landlord, Tenant shall forthwith execute a
new lease with Landlord for a term commencing on the date of such
disclaimer and expiring at what would have been the end of the Term."
```

**Effect**:
- Tenant must step back into lease if assignee goes bankrupt
- Execute new lease on same terms
- Cannot escape via assignee's bankruptcy
- Extremely protective of landlord

**No Release for Loss of Security**:
```
"Tenant's liability hereunder and under the Lease shall not be
released, discharged, mitigated or affected by any loss of or in
respect of any security received or intended to be received by
Landlord from Assignee or from any other person, whether or not
occasioned or contributed to by or through any act, omission,
default or neglect of Landlord."
```

**Effect**:
- Landlord loses assignee's security deposit? Tenant still liable.
- Landlord's negligence loses security? Tenant still liable.
- No duty on landlord to preserve security

**E. Costs and Fees (Section 5)**:

**Standard Provision**:
```
"Tenant shall be responsible for and to promptly pay upon demand,
all legal costs and Landlord's administration fee, if any, properly
incurred by Landlord with respect to this consent to the Assignment
and the preparation of this Agreement."
```

**Typical Costs**:
- Legal fees: $2,000-$5,000
- Administration fee: $500-$2,000
- Credit check fees: $500-$1,000
- **Total**: $3,000-$8,000

**Who Pays**:
- Lease typically requires tenant to pay
- Non-negotiable in most cases
- Tenant can seek reimbursement from assignee (separate agreement)

**F. Acknowledgments (Section 7)**:

**Standard Language**:
```
"Assignee hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the
Lease and is familiar with the terms, covenants and conditions
contained therein."
```

**Purpose**:
- Prevents assignee from claiming ignorance of lease terms
- Assignee has reviewed and accepts all obligations
- Due diligence complete

**G. Confirmation of Lease (Section 8)**:

**Standard Language**:
```
"The Parties hereto acknowledge and confirm that the Lease is in
full force and effect, unmodified except in accordance with this
Agreement."
```

**Purpose**:
- No defaults outstanding
- No side deals or amendments not disclosed
- Fresh start for assignee
- Estoppel effect

**H. Conditions Precedent (Sections 9-10)**:

**Sale Transaction Condition**:
```
"Tenant, Assignee and Subtenant covenant and agree that in the event
the Sale Transaction does not close on, or within one month of, the
Effective Date, this Agreement shall become null and void and the
Tenant will continue as Tenant under the Lease."
```

**Purpose**:
- Assignment often tied to business sale
- If sale fails, assignment doesn't proceed
- Protects all parties from limbo

**Delivery Condition**:
```
"This Agreement shall be deemed not to have been executed and
delivered by Landlord until it has been duly executed by all Parties
hereto, and Landlord has received at least one (1) original executed
copy hereof and at least one (1) original copy of the offer to
purchase and sale agreement."
```

**Landlord's Withdrawal Right**:
- Can withdraw consent if documents not received
- 30-day deadline typical
- Ensures landlord has complete picture

### Sublease Consent Provisions

**When Sublease Occurs Simultaneously with Assignment**:

**Structure**:
1. Tenant assigns lease to Assignee
2. Assignee immediately subleases back to Subtenant
3. Landlord consents to both in one agreement

**Common Scenarios**:
- Professional corporations (doctors, dentists, lawyers)
- Sale of business to holding company
- Corporate restructuring
- Asset vs. share sale structures

**Key Sublease Provisions**:

**A. Landlord's Consent (Sublease)**:

**Standard Language**:
```
"Landlord hereby consents to the Sublease by Assignee to Subtenant
of the Premises for the period from the Effective Date to [End Date],
it being understood that Landlord in granting this consent does not
thereby acknowledge or approve of or agree to be bound by any of the
terms of the Sublease as between Assignee and Subtenant, but is only
consenting to the occurrence of the Sublease."
```

**B. Covenants of Subtenant**:

**Joint and Several Liability (Modified)**:
```
"Subtenant covenants and agrees with Landlord that it, together with
Assignee, shall be jointly and severally bound by all the provisions
of the Lease as applicable to the Premises and, save and except in
respect of the payment of Rent thereunder."
```

**Key Differences from Assignment**:
- Subtenant bound by lease provisions (use, maintenance, insurance, etc.)
- BUT subtenant NOT directly liable for rent to landlord
- Rent flows: Subtenant → Assignee → Landlord
- Landlord's recourse for rent: Against Assignee and original Tenant

**Landlord's Rights Against Subtenant**:
```
"Subtenant agrees with Landlord that, in respect to the Premises
and the contents thereof, Landlord shall have all the rights against
Subtenant which it would have under the Lease and at law if Subtenant
were Tenant."
```

**Effect**:
- Landlord can distrain against subtenant's property
- Landlord can evict subtenant for defaults
- Subtenant must comply with lease provisions
- But rent obligation remains with assignee/tenant

**Use Restrictions**:
```
"Subtenant covenants and agrees that it shall not use the Premises,
nor shall it permit the Premises to be used for any purpose other
than for [specified use], to the extent permitted by all applicable
laws."
```

**Narrower Use**:
- Often more restrictive than lease
- Landlord's additional control
- Reflects subtenant's specific business

**Control Requirement**:
```
"Subtenant shall at all times be under the control of Assignee."
```

**Purpose**:
- Ensures assignee manages subtenant
- Assignee responsible for subtenant's compliance
- No direct subtenant-landlord relationship

**C. Covenants of Assignee (re: Sublease)**:

**Continued Liability**:
```
"Assignee covenants and agrees with Landlord that it is not hereby
released from the performance of any of its obligations pursuant to
the Lease and remains liable, jointly and severally with Subtenant,
for all of the obligations of Tenant under the Lease notwithstanding
the Sublease."
```

**Trust for Rent**:
```
"in the event of a default by Assignee under the Lease, Landlord
shall be entitled to receive all amounts to be paid by Subtenant
under the Sublease and any amounts of rent received by Assignee
directly from Subtenant shall be deemed received by Assignee
'strictly in trust' for Landlord."
```

**Effect**:
- Upon assignee default, landlord can collect rent directly from subtenant
- Subtenant must pay landlord (not assignee)
- Protects landlord's rent stream
- Subtenant's duty to pay is redirected

### Landlord Protections and Strategy

**1. Maintaining Multiple Liable Parties**:

**Liability Waterfall**:
```
Transaction: Tenant → Assignee → Subtenant

Liability for Rent to Landlord:
1st: Assignee (primary - in privity of estate)
2nd: Original Tenant (secondary - in privity of contract)
3rd: Subtenant (indirect - via trust for rent if assignee defaults)
```

**Landlord's Options if Default**:
- Sue assignee (primarily liable)
- Sue original tenant (jointly and severally liable)
- Sue both (joint and several liability)
- Collect from subtenant (if assignee defaulted)
- Pursue any or all until paid in full

**2. No Release of Original Tenant**:

**Critical Protection**:
- Original tenant NEVER released (unless landlord agrees)
- Assignment does not discharge original tenant's liability
- Even if assignee stronger credit than tenant
- Even if landlord approved assignee

**Rationale**:
- Landlord bargained for tenant's credit when lease signed
- Should not lose that credit support
- Tenant chose to assign (voluntary)
- Tenant benefits from assignment (business sale, exit)

**Tenant's Perspective**:
- Assignment feels like exit from lease
- BUT legally remain on hook for full term
- Risk: Assignee defaults, tenant liable for years of rent
- Should monitor assignee's performance

**3. Right to Amend with Assignee**:

**Landlord's Flexibility**:
```
"Landlord and Assignee may agree as between themselves to amend the
terms of the Lease, it being agreed that no such amendments shall
have the effect of releasing Tenant from any of its obligations
under the Lease, for which Tenant shall remain liable to the same
extent as if such amendments had not been made."
```

**Landlord Benefits**:
- Can negotiate rent increases with assignee
- Can modify use clause
- Can extend term
- Can change operating expense allocation
- Original tenant remains liable for ALL amendments

**Tenant Vulnerability**:
- No control over amendments
- Liable for terms never agreed to
- Could be materially more burdensome

**Tenant's Negotiation**:
- Limit amendments to non-material changes
- Require tenant's consent for material amendments
- Define "material" (rent increases >X%, term extensions, use changes)
- Cap liability at original lease economics

**Suggested Tenant-Friendly Language**:
```
"Landlord and Assignee may agree to amend the Lease, provided that:
(a) Any amendment that increases Tenant's financial obligations by
more than 10% shall require Tenant's prior written consent;
(b) Any amendment extending the Term beyond the current Expiry Date
shall release Tenant from obligations for the extended period;
(c) Tenant shall not be liable for any inducements or concessions
granted by Landlord to Assignee."
```

**4. Bankruptcy Protection**:

**Disclaimer Risk**:
- If assignee goes bankrupt, trustee may disclaim lease
- Lease termination would normally end everyone's obligations
- But landlord wants original tenant back on hook

**Landlord's Protection**:
```
"if Assignee is released or discharged in bankruptcy or the Lease
is disclaimed, Tenant shall forthwith execute a new lease with
Landlord for the unexpired Term on the same terms and conditions."
```

**Effect**:
- Tenant must step back into premises
- Execute new lease (not just remain liable)
- Continue operations or find new assignee/subtenant
- Cannot escape via assignee's bankruptcy

**5. No Duty to Preserve Security**:

**Standard Provision**:
```
"Tenant's liability shall not be released, discharged, mitigated or
affected by any loss of or in respect of any security received or
intended to be received by Landlord from Assignee, whether or not
occasioned or contributed to by or through any act, omission, default
or neglect of Landlord."
```

**Scenarios**:
- Landlord accepts $50K letter of credit from assignee
- Landlord fails to renew LC and it expires
- Landlord's negligence but tenant still fully liable

**Tenant's Perspective**:
- Harsh provision
- Landlord has no incentive to protect security
- Tenant should monitor and ensure security maintained

**Tenant's Negotiation**:
- Require landlord to use reasonable efforts to preserve security
- Right to step in and provide replacement security
- Notice if security about to lapse

### Assignee/Subtenant Considerations

**1. Due Diligence Before Taking Assignment**:

**Critical Reviews**:
1. **Entire Lease**: Original lease plus ALL amendments
2. **Consent Agreement**: Understand all obligations being assumed
3. **Premises Condition**: Inspect thoroughly (taking "as is")
4. **Operating Expenses**: Review last 3 years (trending up?)
5. **Outstanding Issues**: Any defaults, disputes, claims?
6. **Landlord's Rights**: Access, alterations approval, assignment restrictions
7. **Renewal Options**: Remaining options and rent determination
8. **Yield-Up**: Restoration requirements at lease end

**Financial Analysis**:
- Current rent vs. market rent (paying premium?)
- Remaining term (adequate for business needs?)
- Operating expense pass-throughs (predictable?)
- Capital expenditure risk (roof, HVAC, structure)
- Total occupancy cost (rent + opex + utilities + parking)

**Legal Review**:
- Use permitted for assignee's business?
- Zoning compliance?
- Environmental issues (Phase I ESA review)
- Building condition (structural, systems, deferred maintenance)
- Insurance requirements (can assignee obtain and afford?)

**2. Negotiating Assignment Terms**:

**With Tenant (Assignor)**:

**Price Allocation**:
- Purchase price for business vs. lease assignment
- Lease premium (if rent below market) or discount (if above market)
- Security deposit transfer or refund

**Representations and Warranties**:
- Lease in good standing (no defaults)
- All amendments disclosed
- No outstanding claims or disputes
- Condition of premises
- Operating expense estimates accurate

**Indemnification**:
- Tenant indemnifies assignee for pre-assignment period issues
- Assignee indemnifies tenant for post-assignment period issues
- Survival period (typically 1-2 years post-closing)

**With Landlord**:

**Consent Conditions**:
- Financial statements required?
- Credit check consent
- Personal guarantee required? (push back if strong corporate assignee)
- Security deposit (letter of credit vs. cash)

**Fees**:
- Consent fee (negotiate cap, e.g., $3,000-$5,000)
- Legal fees (reasonable, with substantiation)
- No ongoing monitoring fees

**Timing**:
- Consent within 30 days of request
- Right to withdraw if business transaction fails
- Effective date tied to business closing

**3. Subtenant-Specific Issues**:

**No Direct Rent Obligation**:
- Subtenant pays rent to assignee (not landlord)
- But if assignee defaults, may pay directly to landlord

**Subordinate Interest**:
- Sublease terminates if lease terminates
- Vulnerable to landlord-assignee disputes
- No direct control over lease compliance

**Non-Disturbance**:
- Subtenant should negotiate non-disturbance from landlord
- If assignee defaults and lease terminates, subtenant can stay
- Attorns to landlord as direct tenant

**Suggested Subtenant Protection**:
```
"In the event the Lease is terminated for any reason, Landlord
agrees that Subtenant's right to occupy the Premises shall not be
disturbed provided that: (a) Subtenant is not in default; (b)
Subtenant attorns to Landlord as direct tenant; and (c) Subtenant
agrees to pay rent directly to Landlord for the remainder of the
Sublease Term."
```

### Common Scenarios and Issues

**Scenario 1: Tenant Wants Full Release**:

**Context**: Tenant selling business and assigning lease. Wants to be released from all liability.

**Landlord's Position**:
- No release
- Standard practice
- Tenant remains liable throughout term
- Non-negotiable

**Tenant's Arguments**:
- Assignee is stronger credit than tenant
- Assignee providing substantial security deposit
- Tenant should be able to exit cleanly
- Will pay release fee

**Landlord's Counter**:
- Bargained for tenant's credit at lease inception
- Assignee untested in this location
- Market may change
- No incentive to release

**Possible Compromises**:
1. **Sunset Provision**: "Tenant released after 2 years if assignee in good standing"
2. **Contingent Release**: "Tenant released if assignee maintains [specified financial ratios]"
3. **Reduced Liability**: "Tenant's liability capped at [6-12 months rent] after [2 years]"
4. **Financial Test**: "Tenant released if assignee maintains net worth of [$X] for [2 years]"

**Typical Outcome**: Landlord refuses release; tenant remains liable

**Scenario 2: Landlord Wants Personal Guarantee from Assignee's Principals**:

**Context**: Assignee is corporate entity. Landlord wants personal guarantees from shareholders/principals.

**Landlord's Position**:
- Assignee is new entity or thin capitalization
- Need additional credit support
- Standard requirement

**Assignee's Position**:
- Corporate entity should stand on own credit
- Principals don't want personal exposure
- Original tenant didn't provide guarantee (why should assignee?)

**Analysis**:

**When Reasonable**:
- Assignee is startup or weak credit
- Assignee is special purpose entity with no assets
- Assignee has poor financial history
- Transaction is asset sale (limited consideration)

**When Unreasonable**:
- Assignee is strong established company
- Assignee has substantial assets and positive financials
- Original tenant did not provide guarantee
- Inconsistent with market practice

**Compromise Options**:
1. **Limited Guarantee**: Cap at [12-24] months rent
2. **Conditional Guarantee**: "Burns off" after 2 years good performance
3. **Multiple Guarantors**: Spread risk among several principals
4. **Letter of Credit Instead**: Assignee provides LC (e.g., 6 months rent)

**Scenario 3: Proposed Use Change**:

**Context**: Assignee wants to use premises for different use than original tenant.

**Example**: Tenant operated dental office; Assignee wants to operate medical marijuana dispensary.

**Lease Use Clause**: "General office and dental purposes"

**Landlord's Analysis**:
1. **Permitted by Lease?** No - marijuana dispensary not "general office or dental"
2. **Zoning Compliant?** Maybe - depends on municipality
3. **Compatible with Building?** No - other tenants may object, insurance issues
4. **Reputation Risk?** Yes - controversial use
5. **Insurance Impact?** Yes - may increase premiums or void coverage

**Landlord's Options**:
- **Refuse Consent**: Use not permitted under lease or unsuitable
- **Consent with Restrictions**: Require use amendment, rent increase, additional insurance
- **Recapture**: Terminate lease, re-let to different tenant

**Likely Outcome**: Landlord refuses consent (legitimate grounds)

**Scenario 4: Assignment to Competitor of Landlord**:

**Context**: Landlord operates competing business. Tenant wants to assign to landlord's competitor.

**Example**: Landlord owns several dental offices. Tenant assigning to competing dental chain.

**Landlord's Position**:
- Unreasonable to support competitor
- Competitor will gain market intelligence
- May use premises to compete against landlord's other locations

**Tenant's Position**:
- Assignee is creditworthy and suitable
- Use is permitted under lease
- Landlord's personal business interests not legitimate grounds

**Legal Analysis**:

**Landlord CAN Refuse If**:
- Express lease provision prohibits assignments to competitors
- Assignee would gain confidential information harmful to landlord
- Would materially harm landlord's business interests

**Landlord CANNOT Refuse If**:
- Purely personal competitive objection
- No legitimate business reason related to property
- Assignee otherwise qualified

**Case Law**: Mixed results; depends on jurisdiction and specific facts

**Compromise**: Confidentiality provisions, non-compete limited to building, rent increase

**Scenario 5: Sublease Profits**:

**Context**: Tenant subleases at rent higher than lease rent. Who gets the profit?

**Example**:
- Lease Rent: $20/sf/year
- Sublease Rent: $25/sf/year
- Profit: $5/sf/year
- On 10,000 sf premises = $50,000/year profit

**Lease Provision** (Landlord-Friendly):
```
"In the event of any subletting, all rent and consideration in
excess of the rent payable under this Lease shall be paid to
Landlord."
```

**Result**: Landlord gets 100% of profit ($50,000/year)

**Tenant's Negotiation**:
```
"Tenant may retain all sublease profits after deducting: (a)
reasonable brokerage commissions; (b) legal fees; (c) tenant
improvement allowance provided to subtenant; (d) free rent
periods; and (e) rent differential during free rent period.
Any remaining profit shall be split 50/50 between Landlord and
Tenant."
```

**Result**: Tenant recoups transaction costs, then splits profit

**Market Practice**: 50/50 split after costs is common compromise

### Drafting Guidance

**For Landlord's Counsel**:

**Key Protective Provisions**:

**1. No Release Language**:
```
"[Tenant/Assignor] covenants and agrees with Landlord that:
(a) it is not hereby released from the performance of any of its
obligations pursuant to the Lease and remains liable, jointly and
severally with [Assignee], for all of the obligations of Tenant
under the Lease, notwithstanding the Assignment or any further or
other assignment of the Lease or subletting or parting with or
sharing possession of all or any part of the Premises;
(b) its obligations pursuant to the Lease and this Agreement shall
extend throughout the Term and any and all extensions or renewals
thereof, whether or not [Tenant/Assignor] has consented to such
extension or renewal;"
```

**2. Amendment Rights**:
```
"Landlord and [Assignee] may agree as between themselves to amend
the terms of the Lease, and no such amendments shall have the
effect of releasing [Tenant/Assignor] from any of its obligations
under the Lease, for which [Tenant/Assignor] shall remain liable
to the same extent as if such amendments had not been made."
```

**3. Joint and Several Liability**:
```
"[Assignee] covenants and agrees that it, together with [Tenant],
shall be jointly and severally bound by all provisions of the Lease
and liable to pay to Landlord all sums of any kind whatsoever and
perform all obligations of any kind whatsoever which Tenant is
obliged to pay or perform under the Lease or otherwise in respect
of the Premises throughout the Term and any renewal or extension
thereof."
```

**4. Bankruptcy/Disclaimer Protection**:
```
"If [Assignee] is released or discharged in any receivership,
bankruptcy, winding up or other creditors' proceeding or the Lease
is disclaimed in any such proceeding or otherwise by a trustee,
receiver or other person, the obligations of [Tenant] shall not
thereby be or be deemed to be released, waived, impaired or affected
but shall continue with respect to the entire Term as if the Lease
had not been disclaimed, and, at the option of Landlord, [Tenant]
shall forthwith execute a new lease with Landlord for a term
commencing on the date of such disclaimer and expiring at what
would have been the end of the Term but for such disclaimer."
```

**5. No Duty to Preserve Security**:
```
"The liability of [Tenant] hereunder and under the Lease shall not
be released, discharged, mitigated or affected by any loss of or
in respect of any security received or intended to be received by
Landlord from [Assignee] or from any other person, firm or
corporation, whether or not occasioned or contributed to, by or
through any act, omission, default or neglect of Landlord."
```

**6. Limited Consent**:
```
"This consent by Landlord is without prejudice to Landlord's rights
under the Lease and at law, and shall not be deemed to authorize
any further or other assignment of the Lease or subletting or
parting with or sharing possession of all or any part of the
Premises."
```

**7. Costs**:
```
"[Tenant] shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay upon
demand, all legal costs and Landlord's administration fee properly
incurred by Landlord with respect to this consent and the
preparation of this Agreement."
```

**For Tenant's Counsel**:

**Key Modifications to Negotiate**:

**1. Limit Landlord's Amendment Rights**:
```
"Landlord and Assignee may agree to amend the Lease, provided that:
(a) Tenant's prior written consent shall be required for any
amendment that:
    (i) increases Tenant's financial obligations by more than [10]%;
    (ii) extends the Term beyond the current Expiry Date;
    (iii) changes the Permitted Use in a manner that increases
         Tenant's obligations or liabilities;
    (iv) adds new material obligations not contemplated by the
         original Lease;
(b) Tenant shall not be liable for any tenant improvement
allowances, free rent periods, or other inducements granted by
Landlord to Assignee."
```

**2. Sunset of Liability**:
```
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be released from all
further obligations under the Lease and this Agreement if:
(a) Assignee has performed all obligations under the Lease for a
period of [24] consecutive months from the Effective Date;
(b) Assignee is not in default under the Lease at the end of such
[24] month period; and
(c) Assignee maintains a minimum net worth of $[X] as of the end
of such [24] month period, as evidenced by financial statements
provided to Landlord."
```

**3. Cap Liability**:
```
"Tenant's maximum liability under the Lease and this Agreement
following the Effective Date shall not exceed [12] months' Base
Rent and Additional Rent, plus reasonable costs of enforcement."
```

**4. Duty to Mitigate**:
```
"In the event of a default by Assignee, Landlord shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate damages, including
by re-letting the Premises, and Tenant shall only be liable for
actual damages suffered by Landlord net of any recovery from
Assignee or any replacement tenant."
```

**5. Notice Rights**:
```
"Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of all notices of
default sent to Assignee concurrently with delivery to Assignee,
and Tenant shall have the right (but not the obligation) to cure
any such default within the same cure period afforded to Assignee."
```

**6. No Personal Guarantee**:
```
"Landlord acknowledges and agrees that no personal guarantee from
[Tenant's principals] shall be required in connection with this
Assignment, and that Tenant's liability is limited to the corporate
entity of [Tenant]."
```

**For Assignee's Counsel**:

**Key Protections**:

**1. Acknowledgment of Condition**:
```
"Assignee acknowledges that it has inspected the Premises and
accepts the Premises in their current 'as is, where is' condition.
Landlord shall have no obligation to perform any work, repairs or
improvements to the Premises."
```

**Important**: Assignee should document condition with photos/video before taking possession.

**2. Confirmation of No Defaults**:
```
"Landlord confirms that, as of the Effective Date:
(a) the Lease is in full force and effect and has not been
modified except as disclosed herein;
(b) to Landlord's knowledge, there are no outstanding defaults
by Tenant under the Lease;
(c) all rent and additional rent have been paid to date;
(d) there are no outstanding claims or disputes between Landlord
and Tenant relating to the Premises or the Lease."
```

**3. Right to Improvements**:
```
"Assignee shall have the right to make non-structural alterations
to the Premises in accordance with Section [X] of the Lease,
subject to Landlord's prior written approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed."
```

**4. Operating Expense Reconciliation**:
```
"Within [30] days of the Effective Date, Landlord shall provide
Assignee with the most recent operating expense reconciliation for
the Premises, showing all amounts paid and owing by Tenant. Assignee
shall only be responsible for operating expenses accruing from and
after the Effective Date."
```

### Best Practices

**For Landlords**:

**1. Proper Credit Review**:
- Obtain 3 years of financial statements
- Run credit check (Dun & Bradstreet, Equifax)
- Check references from prior landlords
- Review business plan and use case
- Assess industry and market trends

**2. Document Review**:
- Review proposed assignment agreement between tenant and assignee
- Verify purchase price and consideration (arm's length?)
- Ensure transaction is bona fide (not sham to avoid lease obligations)
- Confirm closing date and conditions

**3. Security**:
- Consider requiring additional security from assignee
- Letter of credit preferred (3-6 months rent)
- Personal guarantee if weak corporate assignee
- Increase security deposit

**4. Timing**:
- Set reasonable deadline for consent (30 days after complete information)
- Reserve right to withdraw if transaction doesn't close
- Coordinate effective date with business closing

**5. Consistency**:
- Use standard form consent agreement
- Apply same criteria to all consent requests
- Document reasons if refusing consent
- Avoid discriminatory practices

**For Tenants/Assignors**:

**1. Negotiate Assignment Terms in Original Lease**:
- "Landlord's consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed"
- Eliminate recapture rights
- Permit assignments to affiliates without consent
- Profit-sharing (50/50) on favorable subleases
- Sunset of liability after assignment
- Limit landlord's right to amend with assignee

**2. Choose Strong Assignee**:
- Better credit than tenant (improves negotiating position)
- Established business with track record
- Suitable use (no controversial uses)
- Reduces likelihood of landlord refusal

**3. Structure Transaction Properly**:
- If possible, structure as share sale (no assignment needed)
- Consider lease buyout (pay landlord to terminate)
- Time assignment to coincide with renewal (negotiate better terms)

**4. Monitor Assignee Post-Assignment**:
- Remain informed of assignee's performance
- Check if rent being paid
- Monitor for defaults
- Reserve right to cure defaults
- Maintain communication with landlord

**5. Seek Release**:
- Negotiate hard for full release or sunset provision
- Offer additional consideration (release fee)
- Demonstrate assignee's superior credit
- Compromise with time-limited or capped liability

**For Assignees**:

**1. Thorough Due Diligence**:
- Review entire lease (original + all amendments)
- Inspect premises carefully (as-is condition)
- Review operating expenses (3 years history)
- Verify no defaults or outstanding issues
- Check renewal options remaining

**2. Negotiate with Tenant**:
- Obtain representations and warranties
- Indemnification for pre-assignment issues
- Adjustment of purchase price for lease terms
- Transfer of security deposit

**3. Build Relationship with Landlord**:
- Introduce yourself and business
- Provide strong financial information
- Demonstrate stable, responsible tenant
- Open communication

**4. Plan for Contingencies**:
- What if landlord refuses consent? (lease buyout? different location?)
- What if transaction structure changes? (share sale vs. asset sale)
- What if financing falls through?

**5. Understand Full Obligations**:
- Not just rent, but operating costs, taxes, insurance, maintenance
- Yield-up requirements (restoration at lease end)
- Use restrictions (can you expand/change business?)
- Assignment/subletting restrictions (can you exit if needed?)

## How to Use This Skill

This skill is **proactive** and will activate when you:

1. **Draft consent to assignment agreements** - Ensure all protective provisions included
2. **Review consent agreements** - Identify risks and negotiation points for clients
3. **Advise on assignment vs. sublease transactions** - Structure analysis and recommendations
4. **Negotiate consent terms** - Strategic guidance for landlords, tenants, and assignees
5. **Analyze multi-party transactions** - Assignment + sublease combinations
6. **Address assignment/sublease disputes** - Interpret provisions and advise on rights
7. **Advise on release of liability** - Negotiate sunset provisions and caps
8. **Structure professional corporation subleases** - Dentists, doctors, lawyers

Ask me questions like:
- "Review this consent agreement from tenant's perspective"
- "Should we accept this assignment or use recapture rights?"
- "Draft a consent agreement for assignment + sublease transaction"
- "How can tenant negotiate release from liability?"
- "What protections does landlord have if assignee goes bankrupt?"
- "Assignee wants to change use - can we refuse consent?"
- "Structure this professional corporation sale transaction"
