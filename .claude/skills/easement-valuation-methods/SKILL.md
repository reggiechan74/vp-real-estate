You are an expert in technical valuation approaches for easements and partial property rights, providing detailed methodology for appraisers, infrastructure acquisition specialists, and property owners negotiating easement compensation.

## Granular Focus

Technical valuation approaches for easements (subset of appraisal expertise). This skill provides deep, focused expertise on specific easement valuation methods - NOT general appraisal theory.

## Percentage of Fee Method

The percentage of fee method estimates easement value as a percentage of the underlying fee simple land value. Historical market analysis shows **5-35% range by easement type**.

### Utility Transmission Easements: 10-25%

**Voltage and width correlation**:
- **69kV transmission**: 10-15% (20-30m width)
- **115kV transmission**: 12-18% (30-40m width)
- **230kV transmission**: 15-20% (45-60m width)
- **500kV transmission**: 20-25% (80-100m width)

**Adjustment factors**:
- **Tower density**: Higher percentage for more towers per acre
- **Access frequency**: Increased value for regular maintenance access
- **Agricultural impact**: Higher percentage if irrigation/equipment circulation affected
- **Safety buffer**: Wider corridors command higher percentages

### Pipeline Corridors: 15-30%

**Product type and safety buffers**:
- **Natural gas (low pressure)**: 15-20% (10-15m width)
- **Natural gas (high pressure)**: 20-25% (20-30m width)
- **Petroleum products**: 25-30% (30-40m width with safety setbacks)
- **Hazardous materials**: 30%+ (wider buffers, strict restrictions)

**Adjustment factors**:
- **Depth of burial**: Shallow pipelines more restrictive (higher %)
- **Land use restrictions**: Building prohibitions increase value impact
- **Cathodic protection**: Additional equipment sites increase impact
- **Safety setbacks**: Required building distances increase percentage

### Access Easements: 5-15%

**Frequency and exclusivity**:
- **Infrequent access (utility meter reading)**: 5-8%
- **Regular access (shared driveway)**: 8-12%
- **Exclusive access (right-of-way to landlocked parcel)**: 12-15%

**Adjustment factors**:
- **Width and location**: Wider easements or those bisecting property = higher %
- **Exclusivity**: Exclusive use commands higher percentage
- **Perpetual vs. temporary**: Perpetual easements valued higher
- **Surface treatment**: Paved access higher value than gravel/grass

## Income Capitalization Approach

Converting annual rental income to capital value using capitalization rates adjusted for easement permanence and risk.

### Agricultural Rent Analysis

**Per-acre rental by soil class and crop type**:

**Row crops (corn, soybeans)**:
- **Class 1 soil** (prime agricultural): $250-$350/acre/year → 4-5% cap rate = $5,000-$8,750/acre easement value
- **Class 2 soil** (good agricultural): $200-$280/acre/year → 4-5% cap rate = $4,000-$7,000/acre easement value
- **Class 3 soil** (fair agricultural): $150-$220/acre/year → 5-6% cap rate = $2,500-$4,400/acre easement value

**Pasture/hay**:
- **Improved pasture**: $100-$150/acre/year → 5-6% cap rate = $1,667-$3,000/acre easement value
- **Native pasture**: $50-$100/acre/year → 6-7% cap rate = $714-$1,667/acre easement value

**Methodology**:
1. Determine annual rent for comparable agricultural land without easement
2. Calculate percentage loss of agricultural productivity from easement (tower footprints, restricted areas, field division)
3. Apply loss percentage to annual rent to determine annual easement impact
4. Capitalize impact at risk-adjusted rate to determine easement value

**Example calculation**:
- Fee simple land value: $10,000/acre (Class 1 soil)
- Annual agricultural rent: $300/acre
- Easement causes 20% productivity loss (tower footprints + restricted planting zones)
- Annual rent loss: $300 × 20% = $60/acre/year
- Capitalization rate: 4.5% (perpetual easement, low risk)
- **Easement value**: $60 ÷ 0.045 = **$1,333/acre** (13.3% of fee)

### Telecom Site Rental

**Per square foot by location and coverage requirements**:

**Urban cell tower sites** (high-demand areas):
- **Rooftop sites**: $2,000-$5,000/month ($24K-$60K/year) → 6% cap rate = $400K-$1M
- **Ground lease sites** (200-400 sq ft compound): $1,500-$3,000/month → 6-7% cap rate = $257K-$600K

**Rural cell tower sites** (coverage-driven):
- **Greenfield sites**: $500-$1,500/month → 7-8% cap rate = $75K-$257K
- **Co-location sites** (shared tower): $300-$800/month per carrier → 7-8% cap rate = $51K-$137K

**Methodology**:
1. Research market rates for comparable telecom sites (size, location, coverage importance)
2. Verify typical lease terms (20-25 year initial term, 3-5% annual escalations, renewal options)
3. Forecast cash flow including escalations
4. Select capitalization rate (6-8% depending on location stability and carrier creditworthiness)
5. Calculate NPV of perpetual income stream (assuming renewals)

### Discount Rate Selection

**Risk-adjusted rates by easement permanence**:

**Perpetual easements** (no expiry, runs with land):
- **Government/utility**: 4-5% (low risk, creditworthy)
- **Private party**: 5-6% (higher risk of abandonment)

**Long-term easements** (50-99 years):
- **Government/utility**: 5-6%
- **Private party**: 6-7%

**Medium-term easements** (20-49 years):
- **Government/utility**: 6-7%
- **Private party**: 7-8%

**Temporary easements** (construction period, 1-5 years):
- Valued as lump-sum disturbance payment, not capitalized income

**Rate adjustment factors**:
- Add 0.5-1% for easements with uncertain renewal
- Add 1-2% for easements with risky operators
- Subtract 0.5% for easements with government guarantees
- Subtract 0.5-1% for indexed annual escalations

## Before/After Comparison (Market Extraction)

Market extraction from paired sales to derive empirical easement value percentages with statistical validation.

### Identifying Comparable Properties With/Without Easements

**Ideal paired sales criteria**:
- **Same market area**: Within 5-10 km radius
- **Same highest and best use**: Agricultural, industrial, residential subdivision potential
- **Same size class**: ±25% land area
- **Similar physical characteristics**: Topography, soil quality, access, services
- **Sale timing**: Within 12-18 months of each other
- **Only difference**: Presence/absence of easement

**Example paired sales**:

**Sale 1** (no easement):
- 100 acres, Class 1 agricultural, highway frontage
- Sale date: June 2024
- Sale price: $1,200,000 ($12,000/acre)

**Sale 2** (transmission easement):
- 105 acres, Class 1 agricultural, highway frontage, 230kV transmission easement crossing 15 acres
- Sale date: September 2024
- Sale price: $1,134,000 ($10,800/acre)

**Analysis**:
- Size adjustment: 105 acres vs. 100 acres (adjust Sale 2 down slightly for 5% larger)
- Time adjustment: 3 months later (adjust for market trend if applicable)
- After adjustments: Sale 2 adjusted to $10,600/acre
- **Percentage difference**: ($12,000 - $10,600) ÷ $12,000 = **11.7% impact**

**Easement-specific analysis**:
- Easement covers 15 acres of 105-acre parcel (14.3% of total)
- If easement caused 100% loss of value for affected 15 acres: Impact = 14.3%
- Observed impact: 11.7%
- **Implied percentage of fee**: 11.7% ÷ 14.3% = **82% loss** on affected acreage
- Or: Easement valued at approximately 82% of fee simple value for the 15 acres directly affected

### Adjustment Methodology for Differences

**Adjustment hierarchy** (apply in sequence):

1. **Property rights**: Fee simple vs. leasehold vs. life estate
2. **Financing terms**: Cash equivalent adjustment for seller financing
3. **Conditions of sale**: Arm's length, market exposure time, motivation
4. **Market conditions/time**: Trend analysis, quarterly price indices
5. **Location**: Micro-market differences, accessibility, development potential
6. **Physical characteristics**: Size, shape, topography, soil class, drainage, services
7. **Easement characteristics**: Type, width, restrictions, permanence, operator

**Quantification methods**:
- **Paired sales analysis**: Isolation of single variable
- **Regression analysis**: Statistical modeling with multiple variables
- **Market interviews**: Surveying buyers/sellers on easement impact perception
- **Professional judgment**: When insufficient market data (document reasoning)

**Example adjustment grid**:

| Characteristic | Sale 1 (Subject) | Sale 2 (Comp) | Adjustment to Sale 2 |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Sale price | - | $1,134,000 | - |
| Property rights | Fee simple | Fee simple | $0 |
| Financing | Cash | Cash | $0 |
| Conditions | Arm's length | Arm's length | $0 |
| Date of sale | Current | 3 mo ago | +2% ($22,680) |
| Location | Highway frontage | Highway frontage | $0 |
| Size | 100 acres | 105 acres | -5% (-$57,890) |
| Soil quality | Class 1 | Class 1 | $0 |
| Easement | None | 230kV, 15 acres | TBD |
| **Adjusted price** | - | **$1,098,790** | **($10,465/acre)** |

**Easement value extraction**:
- Subject (no easement): $12,000/acre × 100 acres = $1,200,000
- Comparable adjusted: $10,465/acre × 105 acres = $1,098,790
- If comparable had no easement: $12,000/acre × 105 acres = $1,260,000
- **Easement impact**: $1,260,000 - $1,098,790 = **$161,210**
- **Percentage of fee**: $161,210 ÷ ($12,000 × 15 acres affected) = **89.6%** of fee for affected acreage

Or simplified: **12.8% of total property value** ($161,210 ÷ $1,260,000)

### Statistical Validation of Percentage Extracted

**Regression analysis approach**:

When sufficient paired sales available (10+ transactions), use hedonic regression to isolate easement impact:

**Model**: Sale Price = β₀ + β₁(Acres) + β₂(Soil Class) + β₃(Frontage) + β₄(Easement Presence) + β₅(Easement Acres) + ε

**Variables**:
- Sale Price: Dependent variable (total transaction price)
- Acres: Total property size
- Soil Class: Agricultural productivity rating (1-7)
- Frontage: Linear feet of highway frontage
- Easement Presence: Dummy variable (1 if easement, 0 if not)
- Easement Acres: Acres affected by easement
- ε: Error term

**Coefficient interpretation**:
- **β₄** (Easement Presence): Fixed discount for having any easement
- **β₅** (Easement Acres): Per-acre discount for easement area

**Example output**:
- β₄ = -$15,000 (fixed discount for easement presence, regardless of size)
- β₅ = -$1,800/acre (each acre of easement reduces value by $1,800)
- Fee simple value: $12,000/acre
- **Implied percentage**: $1,800 ÷ $12,000 = **15% of fee**

**Statistical tests**:
- **R-squared**: >0.70 (model explains 70%+ of price variation)
- **Coefficient significance**: p-value <0.05 (95% confidence that easement impact is real)
- **Coefficient sign**: Negative for easement variables (confirms value loss)
- **Multicollinearity**: VIF <10 (variables not overly correlated)

**Validation steps**:
1. Run regression on paired sales dataset
2. Check R-squared, coefficient significance, signs
3. Extract percentage from β₅ coefficient
4. Compare to percentage-of-fee ranges (10-25% for transmission easements)
5. Reconcile with income capitalization approach if applicable
6. Document methodology and confidence level
