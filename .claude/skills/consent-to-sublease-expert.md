# Consent to Sublease Agreement Expert

You are an expert in commercial sublease consent agreements and subletting transactions.

## Scope

This skill provides specialized expertise on consent to sublease agreements, including:
- Landlord consent to full or partial subleases
- Three-party consent agreements (landlord, tenant, subtenant)
- Direct vs indirect sublease structures
- Sublease consent provisions in leases
- Reasonableness of landlord consent
- Sublease vs assignment distinctions
- Recapture rights and profit-sharing

## What is a Consent to Sublease Agreement?

A **consent to sublease agreement** is a three-party contract among the landlord, tenant (as sublandlord), and subtenant, whereby the landlord consents to the tenant subletting all or part of the leased premises to the subtenant, subject to specific terms and conditions.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Three parties**: Landlord, Tenant/Sublandlord, Subtenant
2. **Landlord permission required**: Most commercial leases prohibit subletting without landlord's prior written consent
3. **Original lease continues**: The head lease between landlord and tenant remains in full force
4. **Tenant remains liable**: Tenant is not released from lease obligations
5. **Subtenant bound by lease**: Subtenant must comply with lease terms
6. **Landlord not in privity**: Landlord and subtenant have no direct contractual relationship (except as created by consent agreement)

## Legal Structure: Three Relationships

### Relationship 1: Landlord ↔ Tenant (Head Lease)
- **Original lease** continues unchanged
- Tenant remains fully liable for all obligations
- Landlord's rights against tenant unaffected
- Lease term continues to original expiry

### Relationship 2: Tenant ↔ Subtenant (Sublease)
- **Sublease** creates sublandlord-subtenant relationship
- Subtenant pays rent to tenant (not landlord, unless directed)
- Subtenant's term must be shorter than tenant's remaining term (typically 1 day shorter)
- Tenant has landlord-like rights against subtenant

### Relationship 3: Landlord ↔ Subtenant (Consent Agreement)
- **Consent agreement** creates limited direct relationship
- Subtenant agrees to be bound by lease terms
- Landlord has certain enforcement rights against subtenant
- Not full privity of contract (subtenant doesn't pay rent to landlord unless lease defaults)

## Sublease vs Assignment: Critical Differences

| Element | Sublease | Assignment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Original lease** | Continues | Continues |
| **Original tenant liability** | Remains fully liable | Remains liable (unless released) |
| **New occupant pays rent to** | Original tenant (sublandlord) | Landlord |
| **New occupant's term** | Shorter than original lease | Same as remaining lease term |
| **Original tenant retains interest?** | Yes - reversionary interest | No (unless reassignment) |
| **Landlord consent required?** | Usually yes | Usually yes |
| **Landlord's standard** | Reasonable grounds (usually) | Reasonable grounds (usually) |
| **New occupant's relationship to landlord** | Indirect (via consent) | Direct (privity of estate) |
| **Complexity** | More complex (three parties) | Simpler (transfer) |
| **Original tenant benefits** | Keeps lease, can retake space | Gets out of lease (if released) |
| **Profit potential** | Tenant keeps profit (unless shared) | No profit (rent same) |

**Key Insight**: In a sublease, the original tenant remains "in the middle" - collecting rent from subtenant and paying rent to landlord. In an assignment, the assignee takes over the tenant's position directly.

## Why Landlord Consent is Required

### Legal Principle:
Common law generally **allows** assignment and subletting unless the lease prohibits it. However, virtually all modern commercial leases **prohibit** transfer without landlord's prior written consent.

### Prohibition Clause Standard Language:
"The Tenant shall not assign this Lease or sublet the whole or any part of the Premises or otherwise part with or share possession of the Premises or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the Landlord, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed."

### Why Landlords Require Consent:

1. **Quality control** - Ensure subtenant is appropriate for building
2. **Financial security** - Verify subtenant can pay rent
3. **Use control** - Ensure use is compatible with building and other tenants
4. **Reputation management** - Protect building's reputation and tenant mix
5. **Legal compliance** - Ensure subtenant will comply with laws and lease terms
6. **Insurance** - Verify adequate insurance coverage
7. **Relationship** - Know who occupies the building
8. **Recapture opportunity** - Option to recapture space and re-lease directly

## Reasonable vs Unreasonable Consent

### Standard Clause: "Consent Not to Be Unreasonably Withheld"

Most modern commercial leases include this limitation. What's reasonable depends on circumstances, but courts have provided guidance:

### Generally **REASONABLE** Grounds to Refuse:

1. **Financial** - Subtenant has poor credit, inadequate financial strength
2. **Use incompatibility** - Proposed use incompatible with building or other tenants' businesses
3. **Reputation** - Subtenant has poor business reputation, history of litigation with landlords
4. **Legal concerns** - Subtenant in bankruptcy, subject to litigation
5. **Excessive alterations** - Subtenant plans extensive alterations landlord doesn't want
6. **Competing business** - Subtenant competes with landlord's other tenants (if exclusives apply)
7. **Regulatory issues** - Subtenant's use violates zoning, building codes, or regulations
8. **Insurance issues** - Subtenant's use increases insurance costs or voids coverage
9. **Insufficient information** - Tenant hasn't provided required information about subtenant

### Generally **UNREASONABLE** Grounds to Refuse:

1. **Personal dislike** - Landlord simply doesn't like subtenant (no objective basis)
2. **Profit motivation** - Landlord wants to lease at higher rent to another tenant
3. **Arbitrary reasons** - No objective justification
4. **Delay tactics** - Refusing to respond or delaying without reason
5. **Aesthetic preferences** - Subjective design preferences (unless affects building materially)
6. **Competition with landlord** - Subtenant competes with landlord's business (unless express provision)
7. **Loss of recapture right** - Can't refuse just to trigger recapture (unless lease allows)

**Note**: Some leases give landlord **absolute discretion** ("in landlord's sole discretion") which removes reasonableness requirement. Courts may still imply duty of good faith.

## Key Provisions in Consent Agreements

### 1. **Recitals**
Establishes context:
- Original lease details (date, parties, premises, term)
- Prohibition on subletting without consent (cite lease section)
- Sublease details (date, subtenant, portion, term)

**Purpose**: Provides framework for interpreting agreement

### 2. **Landlord's Consent (Section 2)**

**Standard Language**:
"Landlord hereby consents to the Sublease by Tenant to the Subtenant for the Subleased Portion of Premises for the Sublease Term, it being understood that in Landlord granting this consent does not thereby acknowledge or approve of or agree to be bound by any of the terms of the Sublease as between Tenant and Subtenant, but is only consenting to the occurrence of the Sublease."

**Key Elements**:
- Consent is **specific** to this sublease only
- Landlord **not bound** by sublease terms (e.g., landlord not required to provide services to subtenant per sublease)
- Landlord is **not a party** to the sublease

### 3. **Landlord's Rights Continue (Section 3)**

**Purpose**: Preserve all landlord rights under the lease

**Standard Language**:
"This consent by Landlord without prejudice to Landlord's rights under the Lease and at law, and shall not be deemed to authorize any further or other assignment of the Lease or Sublease or subletting or parting with or sharing possession of all or any part of the Premises."

**Key Principle**: **No waiver** - This consent doesn't:
- Waive landlord's rights under lease
- Authorize further subleases (need new consent)
- Authorize assignment of lease or sublease
- Create any precedent for future consents

### 4. **Sublease vs Lease Conflicts (Section 4)**

**Hierarchy Rule**: If sublease conflicts with lease or consent agreement, the **lease/consent prevails**.

**Example**:
- Lease requires $5M insurance; Sublease requires $2M
- Result: Subtenant must carry $5M (lease prevails)

**Rationale**: Landlord didn't negotiate sublease terms, shouldn't be bound by them

### 5. **Subtenant's Covenants (Section 5)**

This is the heart of the consent agreement - brings subtenant under lease obligations:

#### (a) **Bound by Lease Terms**

"Subtenant covenants and agrees with Landlord that it, together with Tenant, shall be jointly and severally bound by all the provisions of the Lease as applicable to the Premises and, save and except in respect of the payment of Rent thereunder."

**Effect**:
- Subtenant must comply with **all lease obligations** (maintenance, insurance, use, etc.)
- **Exception**: Subtenant doesn't pay rent to landlord (pays to tenant/sublandlord)
- **Joint and several**: Both tenant and subtenant liable to landlord

#### (b) **Landlord's Direct Rights Against Subtenant**

"Subtenant agrees with Landlord that, in respect to the Subleased Portion of Premises and the contents thereof, Landlord shall have all the rights against Subtenant which it would have under the Lease and at law if Subtenant were Tenant."

**Effect**:
- Landlord can enforce lease against subtenant directly
- Landlord has distress rights (can seize subtenant's goods for tenant's unpaid rent)
- Landlord can terminate sublease if subtenant breaches lease
- Creates quasi-privity between landlord and subtenant

#### (c) **No Duty to Notify Tenant**

"Whether or not Subtenant pays any amounts payable under the Sublease directly to Landlord, Landlord shall be under no obligation to notify Tenant of any default except only in response to a written inquiry by Tenant to Landlord as to the status of any payment due from or made by Subtenant."

**Effect**:
- Tenant must monitor subtenant's compliance
- Landlord won't alert tenant to subtenant's defaults
- Tenant bears risk of subtenant default

**Landlord Protection**: Reduces landlord's administrative burden

#### (d) **Landlord's Work Deemed Rent**

"If Landlord performs any leasehold improvements or other work or services with respect to the Subleased Portion of the Premises at the request of Subtenant, all amounts payable to Landlord with respect to such improvements, work or services shall be deemed to be rent payable under the Lease."

**Effect**:
- If subtenant requests work from landlord (and landlord agrees), the cost is rent
- Landlord can use lease remedies to collect (distress, termination)
- Protects landlord's ability to collect

#### (e) **Use Restrictions**

"Subtenant covenants and agrees that it shall not use the Subleased Portion of the Premises, nor shall it permit the Subleased Portion of the Premises to be used for any purpose other than [specified use], and ancillary offices therefor, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, and to the extent in keeping with the Building standards as established."

**Key Elements**:
- **Specific use only** (may be narrower than lease allows)
- **Compliance with laws** required
- **Building standards** compliance required
- **Disclaimer**: "Landlord is making no representation or warranty as to Subtenant's ability to use the Subleased Portion of the Premises for its intended use"
- **Subtenant's responsibility**: Verify use is permitted, obtain occupancy permit

**Landlord Protection**:
- Controls building tenant mix
- Shifts compliance risk to subtenant
- No liability for subtenant's inability to use space

#### (f) **Insurance Requirement**

"Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Subtenant shall deliver to Landlord certificate(s) of insurance evidencing requisite insurance coverage under the Lease."

**Effect**:
- Subtenant must provide insurance certificates **before** consent is binding
- Insurance must meet **lease requirements** (not sublease requirements)
- Landlord verifies coverage before approving

#### (g) **As-Is Condition**

"Subtenant will take possession of the Subleased Portion of Premises in the condition in which they were received from Tenant without any obligation on part of Landlord to perform any work therein."

**Effect**:
- Landlord has **no work obligations** to subtenant
- Subtenant takes space **as-is**
- Any work is between tenant and subtenant (per sublease)
- Landlord not involved in subtenant's fit-up

**Landlord Protection**: No landlord costs or obligations

#### (h) **No Signage Rights**

"Subtenant shall not be entitled to any corporate identification in the Building including, without limitation: (i) any entries on the directory board for the lobby of the Building; (ii) any corporate identification on the main entrance to the Premises; or (iii) any entries on any directory board, provided in the elevator lobby on the floor in which the Premises are located, unless expressly agreed to by Landlord in writing."

**Effect**:
- **No automatic signage** for subtenant
- Landlord controls building identity
- May negotiate signage separately

**Rationale**: Landlord wants to control building appearance and tenant visibility

#### (i) **Subtenant Under Tenant's Control**

"Subtenant shall at all times be under the control of Tenant."

**Effect**:
- Tenant (sublandlord) is responsible for managing subtenant
- Landlord's relationship is with tenant, not subtenant
- Tenant must enforce sublease

### 6. **Tenant's Covenants (Section 6)**

#### (a) **Tenant Not Released**

"Tenant covenants and agrees with Landlord that: (a) it is not hereby released from the performance of any of its obligations pursuant to the Lease and remains liable, jointly and severally with Subtenant, for all of the obligations of Tenant under the Lease notwithstanding the Sublease..."

**Critical Principle**: **TENANT REMAINS FULLY LIABLE**

**Effect**:
- Tenant cannot escape lease obligations by subletting
- Tenant and subtenant are **jointly and severally liable**
- Landlord can sue tenant, subtenant, or both
- No release even if subtenant performs perfectly
- Liability continues through renewals/extensions

**Loss of Security**:
"...its liability hereunder and under the Lease shall not be released, discharged, mitigated, impaired or affected by any loss of or in respect of any security received or intended to be received by Landlord from Subtenant or from any other person..."

**Effect**: Even if landlord takes security deposit from subtenant and loses it, tenant still fully liable.

#### (b) **Landlord Can Collect Subrent on Tenant Default**

"In the event of a default by Tenant under the Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to receive all amounts to be paid by Subtenant under the Sublease in respect of such shared occupancy and any amounts of rent received by Tenant directly from Subtenant shall be deemed received by Tenant 'strictly in trust' for Landlord."

**Effect**:
- If tenant defaults, landlord can demand subtenant pay rent directly to landlord
- Subrent is held "in trust" for landlord if tenant defaults
- Landlord can attach subrent as remedy
- Subtenant may be required to pay rent twice (to tenant per sublease, then to landlord if tenant defaults)

**Subtenant Protection**: Need attornment provision protecting subtenant from double payment

### 7. **Costs (Section 7)**

**Standard Provision**:
"Tenant and Subtenant agree to be jointly and severally responsible for and to promptly pay upon demand, all costs properly incurred by Landlord with respect to, and in connection with the preparation of this Agreement."

**Typical Costs**:
- **Legal fees**: $1,500-$5,000 (depending on complexity)
- **Administrative fee**: $500-$2,000 (landlord's internal costs)
- **Credit check**: $100-$500
- **Deposit with consent**: $1,000 + HST typical

**Negotiation Point**:
- Tenant argues: "We're paying rent, landlord shouldn't profit from consent"
- Landlord argues: "Consent imposes costs and risks, tenant should pay"
- **Market standard**: Tenant pays $1,000-$3,000 all-in

### 8. **Default of Subtenant / Termination of Sublease (Section 8)**

#### (a) **Tenant Must Enforce Against Subtenant**

"If Subtenant defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the Sublease or this Agreement, Tenant shall without delay exercise such rights as are available to it under the Sublease or at law or otherwise to either remedy such default or terminate the Sublease."

**Effect**:
- Tenant must **actively enforce** sublease
- Tenant must **notify landlord** of subtenant defaults
- Tenant must **remedy or terminate** if subtenant defaults
- Tenant can't ignore subtenant's breaches

**Landlord Protection**: Ensures tenant manages subtenant

#### (b) **Landlord's Rights Against Subtenant**

"If Subtenant defaults in the performance of any of its obligations to Landlord pursuant to the Lease or this Agreement, Landlord shall have the right to exercise as against Subtenant, in respect of the Subleased Portion of Premises and the contents thereof, all rights available to Landlord under the Lease and this Agreement and at law..."

**Landlord's Remedies**:
- **Distress**: Seize subtenant's goods and chattels
- **Follow goods**: If removed from premises
- **Terminate sublease**: End subtenant's occupancy
- **Terminate lease** (as to subleased portion): Nuclear option

**Notice Requirement**: Landlord must first give tenant notice and opportunity to cure (per lease cure periods)

**Effect of Termination**:
- Binding on both tenant and subtenant
- Landlord can pursue arrears and damages from both
- Doesn't release tenant from lease obligations

### 9. **Assignment and Termination of Lease (Section 9)**

**Sublease Automatically Terminates If**:

#### (i) **Lease is Assigned**
"If the Lease is transferred by Tenant to an arm's length third-party, the Sublease and this Agreement shall terminate forthwith."

**Rationale**: New tenant (assignee) didn't agree to sublease, shouldn't be bound

#### (ii) **Lease is Terminated**
"If the Lease is terminated by Landlord for any reason whatsoever, the Sublease and this Agreement shall terminate forthwith."

**Effect**: Subtenant's occupancy rights end when head lease ends

**Subtenant Risk**: If tenant defaults and landlord terminates lease, subtenant must vacate immediately

#### (iii) **Lease is Disclaimed**
"If the Lease is disclaimed pursuant to any bankruptcy, winding-up or other creditors' proceeding, the Sublease and this Agreement shall terminate forthwith."

**Effect**: If tenant goes bankrupt and trustee disclaims lease, subtenant is out

**Subtenant Protection**: Need non-disturbance agreement (SNDA) from landlord

### 10. **No Sublease Amendments Without Consent (Section 10)**

**Standard Provision**:
"Tenant and Subtenant shall not amend the Sublease without Landlord's prior written consent."

**Effect**:
- Can't extend sublease term without landlord consent
- Can't change subrent without landlord consent
- Can't change use without landlord consent
- Can't change any material terms

**Rationale**: Landlord consented to specific sublease terms, not open-ended changes

### 11. **Notices (Section 11)**

Served per lease requirements, to addresses specified in consent agreement.

### 12. **Subtenant Acknowledgment (Section 12)**

"Subtenant acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Lease and is familiar with the terms, covenants and conditions contained herein."

**Effect**:
- Subtenant can't claim ignorance of lease terms
- Subtenant bound by lease even if sublease is inconsistent

**Best Practice**: Attach copy of lease to sublease

### 13. **Confirmation of Lease (Section 13)**

"The Parties hereto acknowledge and confirm that the Lease is in full force and effect, unmodified except in accordance with this Agreement."

**Purpose**:
- Confirms no outstanding defaults
- Confirms lease hasn't been amended in ways not disclosed
- Estoppel-like representation

### 14. **Delivery (Section 14)**

"This Agreement shall be deemed not to have been executed and delivered by Landlord until it has been duly executed by all the other parties hereto, and Landlord has received at least one original executed copy hereof."

**Effect**: Landlord not bound until **all parties** execute

**Timing**: Subtenant can't occupy until landlord signs

### 15-22. **Standard Provisions**

- **Joint and several**: If multiple persons
- **Successors**: Binding on successors and assigns
- **Privacy policy**: Consent to personal information collection
- **Applicable law**: Governing law and jurisdiction
- **Time of essence**: Strict deadlines
- **Capitalized terms**: Defined per lease
- **No further transfers**: This consent is specific, not general
- **Representations**: Information about tenant/subtenant is accurate

## Landlord Considerations

### Pre-Consent Due Diligence:

1. **Financial Review of Subtenant**
   - Credit report (D&B, Equifax, etc.)
   - Financial statements (last 3 years)
   - Bank references
   - Trade references
   - Litigation search
   - Bankruptcy search

2. **Business Review**
   - Nature of business
   - Reputation in industry
   - Customer profile
   - Operational needs
   - Growth trajectory
   - Why subletting (not direct lease)?

3. **Use Compatibility**
   - Compatible with building?
   - Compatible with other tenants?
   - Any exclusivity conflicts?
   - Zoning compliance?
   - Parking needs?
   - After-hours HVAC needs?

4. **Insurance Verification**
   - Adequate coverage?
   - Naming landlord as additional insured?
   - Waiver of subrogation?
   - Certificates provided?

5. **Sublease Review**
   - Term shorter than lease? (must be)
   - Rent reasonable?
   - Use permitted?
   - Any landlord obligations assumed?
   - Assignment/subletting provisions?
   - Alterations provisions?

6. **Tenant Status**
   - Any defaults under lease?
   - Rent current?
   - Good relationship?
   - Why subletting?
   - Will tenant remain financially strong?

### Negotiation Points (Landlord Perspective):

1. **Use Restrictions**
   - **Goal**: Narrow use (more restrictive than lease if needed)
   - **Justification**: Control building tenant mix
   - **Example**: Lease allows "general office"; consent limits to "accounting firm"

2. **No Signage Rights**
   - **Goal**: No automatic signage for subtenant
   - **Justification**: Control building identity and appearance
   - **Fallback**: Allow building directory only, no exterior signage

3. **No Landlord Work Obligations**
   - **Goal**: As-is delivery, no landlord fit-up
   - **Justification**: Landlord didn't negotiate TI with subtenant
   - **Benefit**: No landlord costs

4. **Subtenant Pays Consent Costs**
   - **Goal**: Tenant and subtenant pay all costs (legal, admin, credit check)
   - **Standard**: $1,000-$3,000 upfront
   - **Justification**: Tenant's transaction, tenant's cost

5. **No Sublease Amendments Without Consent**
   - **Goal**: Control over any sublease changes
   - **Justification**: Consented to specific terms only
   - **Key concern**: Extensions of term

6. **Tenant Not Released**
   - **Goal**: Tenant remains fully liable (joint and several with subtenant)
   - **Justification**: Landlord's original credit didn't include subtenant
   - **Non-negotiable**: Landlord rarely releases tenant

7. **Right to Collect Subrent on Default**
   - **Goal**: If tenant defaults, landlord can collect subrent directly
   - **Justification**: Subrent is landlord's ultimate source of payment
   - **Mechanism**: Subrent held "in trust" for landlord

8. **Sublease Terminates if Lease Terminates**
   - **Goal**: Subtenant's rights are derivative only
   - **Justification**: Can't have sublease without head lease
   - **Effect**: Subtenant at risk if tenant defaults

9. **No SNDA for Subtenant**
   - **Goal**: Don't give subtenant non-disturbance protection
   - **Justification**: Subtenant is temporary, not long-term tenant
   - **Reality**: Sophisticated subtenants may demand SNDA

10. **Recapture Right**
    - **Goal**: Option to recapture space and lease directly to subtenant (or another tenant)
    - **Justification**: If tenant no longer needs space, landlord should have it back
    - **Effect**: Terminates lease as to subleased portion, landlord re-leases at market
    - **Not always included**: Depends on lease language

### Grounds to Refuse Consent:

**Reasonable Grounds** (if lease requires reasonableness):

1. **Financial weakness**: Subtenant has poor credit, inadequate financials
2. **Reputation issues**: Subtenant has history of defaults, litigation with landlords
3. **Use incompatibility**: Use conflicts with building character or other tenants
4. **Increased costs**: Use will increase insurance or operating costs materially
5. **Regulatory concerns**: Use violates zoning, building codes
6. **Insufficient information**: Tenant hasn't provided required information
7. **Lease violations**: Sublease violates lease terms (e.g., term too long)
8. **No subtenant contact**: Can't verify subtenant identity/viability

**Strategic Considerations**:

1. **Is tenant trying to exit?** If so, better to discuss surrender or assignment
2. **Market opportunity?** Could landlord re-lease at higher rent?
3. **Relationship preservation?** Will refusal damage relationship with good tenant?
4. **Future renewals?** Will tenant renew if can't sublet now?

### Risks for Landlord:

1. **Subtenant default**: Tenant may not be able to cover if subtenant defaults
2. **Tenant weakening**: Tenant may become financially weaker with sublet income at risk
3. **Loss of control**: Less direct control over occupant
4. **Increased administration**: More parties to manage
5. **Unauthorized alterations**: Subtenant may alter premises beyond sublease terms
6. **Use violations**: Subtenant may violate use restrictions
7. **Subtenant holdover**: Subtenant may refuse to leave at sublease expiry
8. **Lease termination complications**: Harder to terminate if subtenant involved
9. **Building reputation**: Inappropriate subtenant may harm building reputation
10. **Future leasing**: Subtenant's presence may deter future direct tenants

## Tenant (Sublandlord) Considerations

### Negotiation Points (Tenant Perspective):

1. **Minimize Consent Costs**
   - **Goal**: Cap or reduce landlord's consent fee
   - **Argument**: Shouldn't be profit center for landlord
   - **Market**: $1,000-$2,000 reasonable; negotiate if higher

2. **Reasonable Timeframe for Consent**
   - **Goal**: Landlord must respond within 15-30 days
   - **Argument**: Business opportunity may be lost if delayed
   - **Lease language**: Check if lease specifies timeframe

3. **Criteria for Consent**
   - **Goal**: Clear, objective criteria in lease
   - **Argument**: Reduces uncertainty and negotiation
   - **Best practice**: Have this in original lease, not consent agreement

4. **No Recapture Right**
   - **Goal**: Landlord can't take space back and re-lease
   - **Argument**: Defeats purpose of having lease flexibility
   - **Reality**: Often in lease already; hard to negotiate out

5. **Profit Retention**
   - **Goal**: Keep any excess subrent over head rent (profit)
   - **Argument**: Tenant's investment in improvements, transaction costs
   - **Reality**: Some leases require profit sharing (50/50 typical)

6. **Reasonable Use Restrictions**
   - **Goal**: Don't narrow use beyond lease terms
   - **Argument**: Limits tenant's ability to find subtenant
   - **Reality**: Landlord may insist on narrower use for building compatibility

7. **Sublease Amendment Rights**
   - **Goal**: Ability to amend minor terms without landlord consent
   - **Argument**: Administrative efficiency
   - **Reality**: Landlord usually requires consent for all amendments

8. **SNDA for Subtenant**
   - **Goal**: Landlord agrees not to disturb subtenant if tenant defaults
   - **Argument**: Makes space more attractive to quality subtenants
   - **Reality**: Landlord usually refuses (undermines landlord's leverage over tenant)

9. **Signage Rights for Subtenant**
   - **Goal**: Subtenant can have building directory listing, suite signage
   - **Argument**: Subtenant needs business visibility
   - **Reality**: May negotiate directory only, no exterior signage

10. **Subtenant Direct Payment to Landlord (on tenant default)**
    - **Goal**: If subtenant pays landlord directly (on tenant default), tenant gets credit against lease rent
    - **Argument**: Avoid double payment
    - **Must have**: Otherwise tenant pays lease rent AND loses subrent

### Responsibilities as Sublandlord:

1. **Negotiate and draft sublease** (with legal counsel)
2. **Maintain lease compliance** (tenant still fully responsible to landlord)
3. **Manage subtenant** (enforce sublease, collect rent, handle issues)
4. **Monitor subtenant compliance** (landlord won't notify tenant of subtenant defaults)
5. **Enforce against subtenant** (if default occurs)
6. **Maintain insurance** (tenant's lease obligations continue)
7. **Pay rent to landlord** (even if subtenant doesn't pay)
8. **Coordinate with landlord** (for building access, services, issues)
9. **Handle end of sublease** (ensure subtenant vacates, restores premises)
10. **Remain liable** (joint and several with subtenant for all lease obligations)

### Risks for Tenant:

1. **Subtenant default**: Tenant must still pay full rent to landlord even if subtenant doesn't pay
2. **Subtenant damages**: Tenant liable for any damage subtenant causes
3. **Subtenant alterations**: Tenant liable if subtenant makes unauthorized alterations
4. **Subtenant holdover**: If subtenant won't leave, tenant must evict (and is still liable to landlord)
5. **Lease violations**: Tenant liable if subtenant violates lease
6. **Consent costs**: $1,000-$5,000 in consent fees and legal costs
7. **Profit sharing**: May have to share subrent profit with landlord
8. **Recapture risk**: Landlord may take space back (if lease allows)
9. **Administration burden**: Managing subtenant is time-consuming
10. **Relationship with landlord**: Subtenant issues may strain tenant-landlord relationship

## Subtenant Considerations

### Due Diligence (Subtenant Perspective):

Before signing sublease and consent agreement:

1. **Review Head Lease**
   - Obtain and review complete copy
   - Understand all obligations (you're bound by them)
   - Check for prohibitions or restrictions
   - Verify tenant has right to sublet
   - Check term (sublease must be shorter)

2. **Verify Tenant's Standing**
   - Is tenant current on rent?
   - Any defaults under lease?
   - Certificate from landlord confirming good standing
   - Financial strength of tenant

3. **Verify Permitted Use**
   - Confirm your use is permitted under lease
   - Confirm zoning allows your use
   - Confirm building standards accommodate your use
   - Get zoning confirmation letter if possible

4. **Understand Landlord Services**
   - What does landlord provide? (HVAC, janitorial, security, etc.)
   - What hours? (important for 24/7 operations)
   - Who do you call for service issues?
   - Any additional costs for after-hours HVAC?

5. **Inspect Premises**
   - Current condition
   - Need for alterations
   - Who pays for alterations?
   - Restoration obligations at end of term

6. **Insurance Requirements**
   - What coverage required? (per lease, not sublease)
   - What are costs?
   - Can you obtain required coverage?

7. **Understand Risks**
   - What happens if head lease terminates?
   - What happens if tenant defaults?
   - Do you have non-disturbance protection?
   - Can sublease be extended?

### Negotiation Points (Subtenant Perspective):

1. **Non-Disturbance Agreement (SNDA)**
   - **Goal**: Landlord agrees not to disturb subtenant's occupancy if tenant defaults
   - **Critical**: Without this, subtenant can be evicted even if subtenant is current on subrent
   - **Landlord resistance**: Landlords often refuse (removes leverage over tenant)
   - **Must have for**: Long-term subleases, significant subtenant investment

2. **Attornment Protection**
   - **Goal**: If tenant defaults and subtenant pays rent directly to landlord, subtenant gets credit against sublease rent
   - **Critical**: Avoid double payment (to both tenant/sublandlord and landlord)
   - **Standard provision**: Should be in consent agreement

3. **Direct Services from Landlord**
   - **Goal**: Landlord provides building services directly to subtenant
   - **Reality**: Usually subtenant must go through tenant for service requests
   - **Practical solution**: Get landlord's service contact information

4. **Use Flexibility**
   - **Goal**: Use clause no more restrictive than lease
   - **Watch for**: Landlord narrowing use in consent agreement
   - **Negotiate**: Push back on unnecessary restrictions

5. **Signage Rights**
   - **Goal**: Building directory listing, suite signage
   - **Reality**: Often denied in consent agreement
   - **Negotiate**: At minimum, building directory listing

6. **Sublease Renewal Option**
   - **Goal**: Option to extend sublease (if head lease term permits)
   - **Challenge**: Requires landlord consent
   - **Solution**: Negotiate renewal terms in original sublease and consent

7. **Alterations Rights**
   - **Goal**: Ability to make reasonable alterations
   - **Reality**: Need both tenant (sublandlord) and landlord consent
   - **Negotiate**: Pre-approved alterations list

8. **No Profit Sharing**
   - **Goal**: Don't pay subrent AND share of profit to landlord
   - **Reality**: Profit sharing is between tenant and landlord
   - **Watch for**: Subrent formula that includes profit sharing

9. **Reasonable Consent Costs**
   - **Goal**: Cap contribution to landlord's consent costs
   - **Negotiate**: Split 50/50 with tenant, or cap at $500-$1,000
   - **Watch for**: Open-ended cost obligation

10. **As-Is Clarification**
    - **Goal**: Clear understanding of condition of space
    - **Inspection**: Thorough inspection before signing
    - **Documentation**: Photo documentation, condition report
    - **Negotiate**: If space needs work, who pays?

### Risks for Subtenant:

1. **Termination of head lease**: If tenant defaults and landlord terminates lease, sublease automatically terminates
2. **No direct relationship with landlord**: Must go through tenant for issues
3. **Bound by lease terms**: Even if inconsistent with sublease
4. **No landlord work obligations**: Landlord provides no TI or improvements
5. **Double payment risk**: May have to pay rent to landlord if tenant defaults (and tenant doesn't release subtenant)
6. **Limited term**: Can't stay beyond sublease term (typically shorter than head lease)
7. **Consent for alterations**: Need both tenant and landlord consent
8. **No signage**: May not be visible to customers/clients
9. **Creditworthiness exposure**: Landlord has full information about your business
10. **Joint and several liability**: Liable with tenant for lease obligations (except rent to landlord)

### Red Flags for Subtenant:

1. **No copy of head lease provided** → Can't understand obligations
2. **Tenant refuses landlord estoppel** → May indicate tenant is in default
3. **Sublease term = head lease term** → Improper; should be 1 day shorter minimum
4. **No SNDA and long-term sublease** → High risk if tenant defaults
5. **Tenant won't disclose financial condition** → May be in distress
6. **Landlord slow to consent** → May indicate concerns about transaction
7. **Use restrictions narrower than needed** → May not be able to operate business
8. **Excessive consent costs** → >$3,000 is high; question why
9. **No insurance available at required levels** → Can't comply with consent agreement
10. **Premises in poor condition** → May need expensive improvements

## Partial vs Full Subleases

### Full Sublease (Entire Premises)

**Characteristics**:
- Tenant sublets 100% of leased space
- Tenant typically vacates entirely
- Subtenant is sole occupant

**Landlord Concerns**:
- Why doesn't tenant just assign?
- Is tenant planning to come back?
- Is tenant in financial distress?
- Should landlord exercise recapture right (if available)?

**Tenant Benefits**:
- Keeps lease (in case needs space in future)
- May be able to charge premium subrent
- Flexibility to retake space at sublease expiry

**Issues**:
- Who receives mail?
- Who manages tenant's property left in space?
- Building services coordination

### Partial Sublease (Portion of Premises)

**Characteristics**:
- Tenant sublets less than 100% of space
- Tenant remains in occupancy
- Shared common areas (kitchens, boardrooms, reception, etc.)

**Complexity Factors**:
- **Demarcation**: Need clear boundaries (may require demising wall)
- **Shared areas**: Kitchen, boardroom, reception, washrooms, storage
- **Proportionate share**: How to allocate operating costs?
- **Access**: Separate entrances or shared?
- **Signage**: Suite entrance signage split?
- **Parking**: How many spots does subtenant get?
- **Storage**: Any storage lockers allocated to subtenant?

**Sublease Must Address**:
1. **Exact space description** (attach floor plan)
2. **Shared area rights** (kitchen, boardroom, etc.) and schedule
3. **Proportionate share calculation** (percentage of total space)
4. **Services allocation** (internet, phone system, reception)
5. **Access arrangements** (keys, access cards, after-hours)
6. **Parking allocation** (number of spots, location)
7. **Storage allocation** (if any)
8. **Signage rights** (suite entrance, building directory)
9. **House rules** (noise, visitors, kitchen use, etc.)

**Consent Agreement Must Address**:
- Landlord consents to partial sublease of specified portion only
- Floor plan attached showing subleased portion
- Proportionate share confirmed (e.g., "40% of Premises")
- Any landlord concerns about shared use addressed

## Direct vs Indirect Subrent Payment

### Indirect Payment (Standard)

**Structure**: Subtenant pays subrent to Tenant → Tenant pays rent to Landlord

**Advantages**:
- Landlord not involved in subrent collection
- Tenant maintains control over subtenant
- Clear separation of head lease and sublease

**Disadvantages**:
- If tenant defaults on lease but subtenant is paying, landlord must take action against tenant
- Tenant may misuse subrent (not pay landlord)

### Direct Payment (on Tenant Default)

**Structure**: If tenant defaults, Landlord directs subtenant to pay subrent directly to Landlord

**Trigger**: Tenant default under head lease

**Mechanism**:
- Consent agreement includes provision allowing landlord to direct subtenant to pay landlord directly
- Subrent held "in trust" for landlord if tenant in default
- Subtenant must comply with landlord's direction

**Protection for Subtenant**:
Need provision that if subtenant pays landlord directly, subtenant is credited against sublease obligations (no double payment).

**Sample Language**:
"In the event Tenant defaults under the Lease, Landlord may, upon written notice to Subtenant, require Subtenant to pay all rent due under the Sublease directly to Landlord. Any such payments by Subtenant to Landlord shall discharge Subtenant's obligation to pay rent to Tenant under the Sublease to the extent of such payments."

## Recapture Rights

### What is Recapture?

**Recapture** is landlord's right to terminate the lease as to the space tenant wants to sublet, and re-lease that space directly to the proposed subtenant (or another tenant).

### When Available?

Only if **lease specifically grants** recapture right. Not implied.

**Typical Lease Language**:
"If Tenant requests Landlord's consent to sublet all or any portion of the Premises, Landlord may, in lieu of granting such consent, elect to recapture such portion of the Premises. Landlord shall have sixty (60) days from receipt of Tenant's request to exercise such recapture right. If Landlord exercises such right, the Lease shall terminate as to the recaptured portion, and Basic Rent and Tenant's Proportionate Share shall be reduced proportionately."

### Landlord's Decision: Consent vs Recapture?

**Factors Favoring Recapture**:
- Subtenant is strong credit, would make good direct tenant
- Market rents have increased; can re-lease at higher rent
- Lease term is long; want to lock in new tenant for full term
- Tenant may be weakening; prefer direct relationship with subtenant
- Subtenant's use is attractive for building
- Opportunity to restructure space

**Factors Favoring Consent**:
- Keep good relationship with tenant
- Tenant may renew lease in future
- Tenant has other locations with landlord (portfolio relationship)
- Recapture is administratively complex
- Subrent is close to head rent (no economic advantage)
- Partial sublease (too small to recapture)

### Tenant's Perspective on Recapture:

**Disadvantages**:
- Loses space (may need it in future)
- Loses flexibility
- Loses potential profit (if subrent > head rent)
- Rent reduction may be proportionately less than space lost (if below-market head rent)

**Advantages**:
- Released from lease obligations for recaptured space
- Rent reduction (proportionate)
- Simplified management (no subtenant to manage)

**Negotiation**:
- Negotiate recapture right OUT of lease if possible
- If must include, limit to full sublease only (not partial)
- Limit to sublease term >5 years
- Require landlord to compensate tenant for unamortized improvements

## Profit Sharing

### What is Profit?

**Profit** = Subrent received by tenant - Head rent paid by tenant

**Example**:
- Tenant pays landlord: $30/SF ($300,000/year for 10,000 SF)
- Tenant receives from subtenant: $35/SF ($350,000/year)
- Profit: $5/SF ($50,000/year)

### Profit Sharing Provisions

Some leases require tenant to share profit with landlord:

**Typical Lease Language**:
"If the total rent payable by a subtenant exceeds the pro rata portion of rent payable by Tenant under this Lease (calculated on a per square foot basis), Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of such excess, less Tenant's reasonable subletting costs (legal fees, brokerage commissions, tenant improvements, free rent)."

**50/50 split is market standard** (though 100% to landlord or 100% to tenant also exist)

### Calculating Profit:

**Gross Subrent**: $350,000/year

**Less: Pro Rata Head Rent**: $300,000/year

**Less: Subletting Costs**:
- Legal fees: $10,000
- Brokerage commission: $17,500 (5% of subrent)
- Tenant improvements for subtenant: $50,000 (amortized over 5-year sublease term = $10,000/year)
- Free rent given to subtenant: 3 months ($87,500, amortized over sublease term = $17,500/year)

**Net Profit**: $350,000 - $300,000 - $10,000 - $17,500 - $10,000 - $17,500 = -$5,000

**Result**: No profit to share in year 1 (costs exceed gross profit)

### Landlord's Perspective:

**Arguments For Profit Sharing**:
- Lease was negotiated at a certain rent; tenant shouldn't profit from market rent increases
- Landlord's building improvements increased value, enabling profit
- Without profit sharing, tenant has incentive to sublet rather than assign (landlord loses direct relationship)

**Arguments Against**:
- Creates disincentive for tenant to sublet (may leave space vacant instead)
- Complicated to calculate and administer
- Tenant bore risk of below-market lease (should enjoy upside)

### Tenant's Perspective:

**Arguments Against Profit Sharing**:
- Tenant paid for leasehold improvements (substantial investment)
- Tenant bears risk if subtenant defaults (should get reward for risk)
- Tenant incurred subletting costs (legal, brokerage, subtenant TI, free rent)
- Tenant negotiated good deal; shouldn't be penalized
- Market standard is for tenant to keep profit

**Negotiation Strategies**:
- Negotiate NO profit sharing in original lease
- If must include, limit to 25% to landlord (75% to tenant)
- Broad definition of "subletting costs" (include all soft costs, improvement amortization, free rent)
- Floor on profit (e.g., first $5/SF of profit goes entirely to tenant)
- Exclude "assignment premium" (lump sum paid by subtenant for tenant's improvements)

## SNDA (Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreement)

### What is SNDA in Sublease Context?

**SNDA** is a three-party agreement among landlord, tenant, and subtenant providing that:

1. **Subordination**: Subtenant's rights are subordinate to head lease
2. **Non-Disturbance**: Landlord won't disturb subtenant's occupancy if tenant defaults (provided subtenant is not in default)
3. **Attornment**: Subtenant agrees to attorn to (recognize) landlord as landlord under sublease if head lease terminates

### Why Subtenant Needs SNDA:

**Problem**: Without SNDA, if tenant defaults and landlord terminates head lease, sublease automatically terminates and subtenant must vacate immediately, even if subtenant is current on all subrent payments and not in default.

**Solution**: SNDA protects subtenant from losing occupancy due to tenant's default.

### Why Landlord Resists SNDA:

1. **Leverage**: If tenant defaults, landlord wants ability to terminate all occupancy and re-lease
2. **Subrent capture**: Without SNDA, subtenant must negotiate new lease with landlord (potentially at higher rent)
3. **Complexity**: SNDA creates ongoing relationship with subtenant
4. **Subtenant obligations**: Landlord may not want to be bound by sublease terms (lower rent, longer term, etc.)

### Negotiation:

**Subtenant Leverage**:
- Long-term sublease (>3 years): SNDA more justifiable
- Substantial subtenant investment: SNDA protects investment
- Financially strong subtenant: Landlord may want to preserve relationship
- Weak tenant: If tenant is weak credit, landlord may prefer strong subtenant stay

**Landlord Conditions for SNDA**:
- Subtenant must pay rent directly to landlord if tenant defaults
- Subrent must be at or above market
- Subtenant must meet landlord's credit standards
- Sublease term can't exceed head lease term
- Subtenant bound by all lease terms
- SNDA terminates if subtenant defaults

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid

### Landlord Mistakes:

1. **Insufficient financial due diligence on subtenant**
   - **Result**: Subtenant defaults, tenant can't cover, landlord loses rent
   - **Solution**: Thorough credit report, financial statements, references

2. **Not reviewing sublease**
   - **Result**: Sublease contains terms inconsistent with lease (e.g., landlord work obligations)
   - **Solution**: Review sublease carefully; consent agreement should state lease/consent prevails

3. **Allowing term = head lease term**
   - **Result**: Sublease is actually an assignment (no reversionary interest to tenant)
   - **Solution**: Require sublease term to be at least 1 day shorter than head lease remaining term

4. **Not verifying insurance before signing consent**
   - **Result**: Subtenant occupies without adequate insurance
   - **Solution**: Require insurance certificates concurrent with execution

5. **Granting consent without "no further transfers" language**
   - **Result**: May be deemed to have waived consent requirement for future transfers
   - **Solution**: Include standard language that consent is specific to this sublease only

6. **Not considering recapture**
   - **Result**: Missed opportunity to recapture space and re-lease at market rates
   - **Solution**: Evaluate recapture right (if available in lease) before consenting

7. **No provision for collecting subrent on tenant default**
   - **Result**: If tenant defaults, landlord can't easily access subrent
   - **Solution**: Include provision allowing landlord to direct subtenant to pay directly on tenant default

### Tenant Mistakes:

1. **Not obtaining landlord consent before signing sublease**
   - **Result**: Sublease is void if landlord refuses consent; subtenant may sue tenant
   - **Solution**: Make sublease expressly conditional on landlord consent

2. **Not budgeting for consent costs**
   - **Result**: Surprise $1,000-$5,000 bill
   - **Solution**: Budget for costs; negotiate cap with landlord if possible

3. **Weak subtenant screening**
   - **Result**: Subtenant defaults; tenant must still pay landlord
   - **Solution**: Screen subtenant as carefully as if you were the landlord

4. **Poor sublease drafting**
   - **Result**: Disputes with subtenant, tenant has weak remedies
   - **Solution**: Use experienced real estate lawyer to draft sublease

5. **Not managing subtenant actively**
   - **Result**: Subtenant violates lease, landlord sues tenant
   - **Solution**: Monitor subtenant compliance, enforce sublease promptly

6. **Not understanding profit sharing obligations**
   - **Result**: Landlord claims unexpected share of subrent
   - **Solution**: Review lease profit-sharing provision; calculate net profit before agreeing to subrent

7. **Granting subtenant rights beyond lease**
   - **Result**: Subtenant expects services/rights that landlord won't provide
   - **Solution**: Sublease should not grant rights beyond what lease provides

### Subtenant Mistakes:

1. **Not reviewing head lease**
   - **Result**: Unaware of obligations; surprised by restrictions
   - **Solution**: Obtain and review full copy of head lease before signing sublease

2. **Not obtaining estoppel certificate from landlord**
   - **Result**: Tenant may be in default; sublease at risk
   - **Solution**: Request estoppel from landlord confirming lease is in good standing

3. **Not negotiating SNDA**
   - **Result**: If tenant defaults, subtenant must vacate even if current on rent
   - **Solution**: Negotiate SNDA if long-term sublease or substantial investment

4. **Assuming landlord will provide services directly**
   - **Result**: Landlord refuses to deal with subtenant; must go through tenant
   - **Solution**: Understand consent agreement provides no direct landlord services

5. **Not documenting premises condition**
   - **Result**: Dispute at end of term over restoration obligations
   - **Solution**: Photo documentation, condition report at commencement

6. **Not verifying permitted use**
   - **Result**: Can't get occupancy permit or operate business
   - **Solution**: Verify zoning, building codes, lease restrictions before signing

7. **Over-investing in leasehold improvements**
   - **Result**: Lose investment if tenant defaults and lease terminates
   - **Solution**: Minimize investment, or negotiate SNDA to protect investment

## Sample Clauses

### Landlord-Favorable Clause (Tenant Not Released):

"Tenant acknowledges and agrees that this consent does not in any way release, discharge, or diminish Tenant's obligations under the Lease. Tenant shall remain primarily, directly, and fully liable for all obligations under the Lease, jointly and severally with Subtenant, notwithstanding the Sublease or any further assignment, sublease, or other transfer. Tenant's liability shall not be affected, impaired, or diminished by: (a) any loss of security deposit or other security provided by Subtenant; (b) any default by Subtenant; (c) any amendment to the Lease agreed between Landlord and Tenant; (d) any forbearance, extension, or indulgence granted by Landlord to Tenant or Subtenant; or (e) any other circumstance whatsoever. For greater certainty, if Subtenant defaults under the Sublease or this Agreement, Landlord may pursue its remedies against Tenant, Subtenant, or both, in Landlord's sole discretion."

### Subtenant-Favorable Clause (Attornment Protection):

"Subtenant and Landlord agree that if Tenant defaults under the Lease and Landlord requires Subtenant to pay rent directly to Landlord, then: (a) any amounts paid by Subtenant to Landlord shall fully discharge Subtenant's obligation to pay rent to Tenant under the Sublease to the extent of such payments; (b) Subtenant shall not be required to pay rent to both Tenant and Landlord; and (c) Landlord shall credit such payments against Tenant's rent obligations under the Lease. Subtenant shall have no obligation to monitor whether Tenant has defaulted under the Lease or to independently determine whether to pay Landlord directly; Subtenant shall be entitled to rely solely on written notice from Landlord directing payment."

### Balanced Clause (Sublease Termination on Lease Termination):

"Subtenant acknowledges and agrees that the Sublease is derivative of and subordinate to the Lease. If the Lease is terminated for any reason, including but not limited to: (i) Landlord's termination for Tenant's default; (ii) Tenant's surrender of the Lease; (iii) disclaimer or repudiation in bankruptcy, receivership, or insolvency proceedings; or (iv) expiry of the Lease term, then the Sublease shall automatically terminate concurrently without any liability of Landlord to Subtenant. Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, offer Subtenant a new direct lease on terms and conditions to be negotiated in good faith. Subtenant waives any claim against Landlord for damages arising from such termination of the Sublease, provided that this waiver shall not apply if: (a) Landlord has granted Subtenant a non-disturbance agreement; and (b) the Lease termination was due solely to Tenant's default and Subtenant was not in default under the Sublease."

### Landlord-Favorable Clause (No SNDA Implied):

"Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting Subtenant any non-disturbance rights or protection against the termination of the Sublease upon termination of the Lease. Subtenant acknowledges that it has not received and is not entitled to any non-disturbance agreement from Landlord. Subtenant's sole recourse for any losses arising from termination of the Sublease due to termination of the Lease shall be against Tenant under the Sublease, and Subtenant releases Landlord from any and all claims related thereto."

## Analysis Framework

When reviewing a consent to sublease agreement, use this 12-step framework:

### 1. **Verify Parties and Premises**
- Who is landlord, tenant, and subtenant?
- What is the head lease (date, term, expiry)?
- What portion of premises is being sublet (square footage, floor plan)?
- Is it full or partial sublease?

### 2. **Verify Sublease Details**
- What is the sublease term (start and end dates)?
- Is sublease term shorter than head lease remaining term? (must be)
- What is the subrent (PSF and total)?
- What is the use?

### 3. **Check Consent Scope**
- Is landlord's consent specific to this sublease only?
- Does consent language clarify landlord is not bound by sublease terms?
- Is there "no further transfers" language?

### 4. **Assess Tenant's Continuing Liability**
- Does agreement confirm tenant remains fully liable?
- Is tenant's liability joint and several with subtenant?
- Is tenant released from any obligations? (should not be)
- Does tenant's liability survive even if landlord loses subtenant's security?

### 5. **Review Subtenant's Obligations**
- Is subtenant bound by all lease terms?
- Does landlord have direct enforcement rights against subtenant?
- Is there a "lease/consent prevails" hierarchy clause?
- What specific obligations are imposed on subtenant?
  - Insurance certificates
  - As-is condition
  - Use restrictions
  - No signage rights
  - Landlord work deemed rent

### 6. **Examine Default and Termination Provisions**
- What happens if subtenant defaults?
- Can landlord enforce directly against subtenant?
- Must landlord give tenant notice and opportunity to cure first?
- What are landlord's remedies (distress, terminate sublease, terminate lease)?
- Does sublease terminate if head lease terminates?
- What triggers automatic sublease termination (lease assignment, lease termination, bankruptcy disclaimer)?

### 7. **Assess Financial Terms**
- Who pays consent costs (tenant, subtenant, both)?
- How much? (reasonable?)
- Is there profit sharing? (check head lease)
- Can landlord collect subrent directly if tenant defaults?
- Is subrent held "in trust" for landlord if tenant defaults?
- Is there attornment protection for subtenant (credit against sublease if paying landlord directly)?

### 8. **Check Use Restrictions**
- What use is permitted?
- Is it more restrictive than head lease? (landlord's prerogative, but note)
- Does subtenant acknowledge no landlord warranty of use?
- Is subtenant responsible for zoning/occupancy permit verification?

### 9. **Review Insurance and Condition**
- What insurance is required (coverage, limits, certificates)?
- When must certificates be provided (concurrent with execution)?
- What condition are premises delivered (as-is)?
- Does landlord have any work obligations to subtenant (should be none)?

### 10. **Assess Subtenant Protections (or Lack Thereof)**
- Is there SNDA for subtenant? (usually no)
- Is there attornment protection (credit if paying landlord directly)? (should be yes)
- Can subtenant amend sublease without landlord consent? (usually no)
- Does subtenant have signage rights? (usually no)
- What happens to subtenant if tenant defaults? (sublease terminates unless SNDA)

### 11. **Check Amendment and Assignment Provisions**
- Can sublease be amended without landlord consent? (usually no)
- Can sublease be assigned by subtenant without landlord consent? (usually no, requires both tenant and landlord consent)
- Can subtenant further sublet? (usually prohibited)

### 12. **Flag Unusual or Aggressive Terms**
- Any unusual landlord rights or protections?
- Any unusual subtenant obligations?
- Any terms inconsistent with market standards?
- Any missing standard protections?
- Any ambiguous terms likely to cause disputes?

## Red Flags

### For Landlords:

1. **Sublease term equals head lease remaining term** → This is actually an assignment; reject
2. **Subtenant's use incompatible with building** → Risk to building reputation and other tenants
3. **Subtenant has poor credit** → High default risk
4. **Tenant won't provide subtenant financial information** → Can't assess risk
5. **Sublease grants landlord obligations** → Subtenant may expect services from landlord
6. **Tenant is already in default** → Sublease may be desperation move
7. **No insurance certificates provided** → Subtenant may not have coverage
8. **Subrent is significantly below market** → Tenant may be in distress; subtenant may be related party
9. **Frequent sublease amendment requests** → Suggests original terms not well-considered
10. **Subtenant requests SNDA immediately** → May know something about tenant's financial condition

### For Tenants:

1. **Subtenant has weak financials** → High risk of default; tenant still liable to landlord
2. **Landlord demands excessive consent costs** → >$5,000 is aggressive; negotiate
3. **Landlord proposes profit sharing not in lease** → Reject; only bound by lease terms
4. **Landlord refuses to respond to consent request** → May be unreasonably withholding consent
5. **Landlord wants to narrow permitted use significantly** → May make space unmarketable
6. **Subtenant proposes sublease term = head lease term** → Improper; suggest 1 day shorter
7. **Subtenant wants extensive alterations** → May need landlord consent; adds complexity and cost
8. **Subtenant requests services beyond lease** → Can't provide what landlord doesn't provide
9. **Landlord wants to exercise recapture right** → Lose space and flexibility
10. **Subtenant won't provide insurance certificates** → Can't get landlord consent

### For Subtenants:

1. **Tenant refuses to provide copy of head lease** → Can't understand obligations; red flag about tenant's standing
2. **Landlord won't provide estoppel certificate** → May indicate tenant is in default
3. **Sublease term = head lease term** → Improper; risky
4. **No attornment protection in consent agreement** → Risk of double rent payment
5. **Use restriction narrower than business needs** → May not be able to operate
6. **Consent agreement requires subtenant to pay all costs** → Should split with tenant
7. **No SNDA and long-term sublease (>3 years)** → High risk if tenant defaults
8. **As-is condition but space needs substantial work** → Who pays? Clarify before signing
9. **Insurance requirements beyond what subtenant can obtain** → Can't comply; deal won't close
10. **Tenant won't disclose financial condition** → May be in distress; sublease at risk

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill complements:

## Key Takeaways

1. **Three-party structure** - Landlord, tenant/sublandlord, and subtenant all have distinct interests
2. **Tenant not released** - Tenant remains fully liable under head lease (joint and several with subtenant)
3. **Sublease subordinate to lease** - If head lease terminates, sublease automatically terminates
4. **Subtenant bound by lease** - Subtenant must comply with all lease terms, not just sublease terms
5. **No automatic SNDA** - Subtenant has no non-disturbance protection unless separately negotiated
6. **Consent is specific** - Landlord's consent is to this sublease only, not to future transfers
7. **Landlord has limited obligations** - No work obligations to subtenant, no direct services
8. **Use restrictions matter** - Landlord may narrow use beyond lease restrictions
9. **Profit sharing is negotiable** - Check lease for profit-sharing provisions
10. **Due diligence is critical** - All parties should thoroughly review head lease, sublease, and consent agreement before signing
