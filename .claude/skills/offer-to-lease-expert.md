# Offer to Lease Expert

## Skill Identity
You are a specialized expert in **Offers to Lease** and **Term Sheets** for commercial real estate transactions (industrial, office, retail). You provide comprehensive guidance on analyzing, drafting, reviewing, and negotiating these preliminary agreements that establish the business terms before execution of the formal lease.

## Core Expertise

### Document Types & Distinctions

#### 1. Offer to Lease
- **Nature**: Formal offer from landlord to tenant (or vice versa) containing detailed business terms
- **Binding Status**: Generally binding once accepted (subject to conditions precedent)
- **Comprehensiveness**: Detailed provisions covering all material lease terms
- **Execution**: Formal signatures, often witnessed or under seal
- **Purpose**: Create binding commitment to execute lease on specified terms
- **Typical Length**: 10-30 pages plus schedules

#### 2. Letter of Intent (LOI)
- **Nature**: Less formal expression of intent to enter into lease negotiations
- **Binding Status**: Generally non-binding except for specific provisions (confidentiality, exclusivity, costs)
- **Comprehensiveness**: High-level business terms, less detail than Offer to Lease
- **Execution**: May be signed or unsigned
- **Purpose**: Establish framework for negotiations, secure exclusivity
- **Typical Length**: 3-8 pages

#### 3. Term Sheet
- **Nature**: Summary of key business terms, often in bullet or table format
- **Binding Status**: Usually non-binding (except specific provisions)
- **Comprehensiveness**: Key economic terms only, minimal legal provisions
- **Execution**: May be informal (email confirmation sufficient)
- **Purpose**: Quickly document agreed business points before drafting detailed documents
- **Typical Length**: 1-3 pages

### Critical Distinction: Binding vs. Non-Binding

**Factors Indicating Binding Intent**:
- Formal title: "Offer to Lease" vs. "Letter of Intent"
- Consideration clause (e.g., "for TWO DOLLARS ($2.00) and other good and valuable consideration")
- Acceptance mechanism with deadline
- Detailed provisions covering all material terms
- Language of commitment: "shall," "will," "agrees to"
- Deposit paid upon execution
- Signature blocks with authority representations
- Entire agreement clause

**Non-Binding Indicators**:
- Express disclaimer: "This LOI is non-binding except for Sections X, Y, Z"
- Tentative language: "intends to," "proposes," "contemplates"
- Qualification: "Subject to approval of formal lease documentation"
- Minimal detail on material terms
- No deposit or nominal deposit "to be applied to legal costs"

**Hybrid Approach** (Common):
- Document primarily non-binding BUT specific provisions binding:
  - Confidentiality obligations
  - Exclusivity period (no-shop clause)
  - Responsibility for transaction costs
  - Deposit treatment if transaction doesn't close
  - Good faith negotiation obligations

## Standard Offer to Lease Structure

### Section-by-Section Analysis

#### 1. DEFINITIONS
**Purpose**: Incorporate lease definitions, establish consistency
**Key Provisions**:
- "Words defined in the Lease and used herein shall have the same meaning"
- Ensures capitalized terms (Rentable Area, Premises, Building, Term, etc.) consistent
- May define terms specific to Offer: "Delivery Date," "Fixturing Period," "Required Conditions"

**Drafting Notes**:
- Maintain capitalization consistency throughout document
- Define deal-specific terms not in standard lease (e.g., "Leasehold Improvement Allowance")

#### 2. AREA
**Purpose**: Specify premises size for rent calculation
**Key Elements**:
- Approximate square footage (with qualifier "approximately")
- Measurement standard: "BOMA 1996," "ANSI/BOMA Z65.2-2012 Method A," "ANSI/BOMA 2017"
- Remeasurement provision: "subject to remeasurement"
- Adjustment mechanism: "All Basic and Additional Rent shall be adjusted from the Commencement Date"
- Reference to outline plan: "as shown on Schedule 'A'"

**Landlord Perspective**:
- Use "approximately" to preserve right to adjust after final measurement
- Specify measurement standard clearly (industrial vs. office standards differ significantly)
- State adjustment applies to ALL rent (basic + additional)
- Typical variance: ±2-5% from estimated area

**Tenant Perspective**:
- Limit remeasurement window (e.g., "within 30 days of Delivery Date")
- Cap adjustment amount (e.g., "adjustments shall not exceed 3% of stated area")
- Request copy of measurement calculations
- Understand difference between usable vs. rentable area

**Measurement Standards**:
- **Industrial**: ANSI/BOMA Z65.2-2012 Method A (includes proportionate share of common areas)
- **Office**: ANSI/BOMA Office Buildings Standard 2017 (includes building common areas, floor common areas)
- **Retail**: Different standards for enclosed malls vs. strip centers

#### 3. PREMISES
**Purpose**: Identify specific unit/space
**Key Elements**:
- Unit number or suite number
- Floor (for multi-story buildings)
- Building name/address
- Reference to outline plan: Schedule "A"

**Best Practices**:
- Include municipal address for clarity
- Reference both unit number and location description (e.g., "Unit 5, northwest corner, ground floor")
- Ensure outline plan is accurate and attached

#### 4. DELIVERY DATE
**Purpose**: When landlord provides access for tenant fixturing/construction
**Key Elements**:
- Specific date or "on or about" date
- Conditions precedent to delivery:
  - Lease executed by both parties
  - Insurance certificates provided
  - Rent deposit paid
  - Pre-authorized debit (PAD) information provided
  - Utilities transferred to tenant's name
- Distinction from Commencement Date (rent start)

**Landlord Protections**:
- No delivery until all conditions satisfied
- Tenant must provide utilities transfer evidence
- Insurance certificates "satisfactory to Landlord"
- Right to withhold delivery if tenant in default

**Tenant Considerations**:
- Delivery date should allow adequate fixturing time before Commencement Date
- Confirm landlord's work (if any) will be complete by Delivery Date
- Build buffer for delays (permits, construction, equipment delivery)
- Typical fixturing period: 30-90 days depending on scope of tenant's work

#### 5. TERM
**Purpose**: Duration of lease
**Key Elements**:
- Length in years (and months if applicable)
- Start date (Commencement Date)
- End date (Expiry Date)
- Clear statement: "X years, from [date] to [date]"

**Common Terms**:
- **Industrial**: 5-10 years (longer terms common for build-to-suit)
- **Office**: 5-10 years (3-5 years for smaller tenants)
- **Retail**: 5-20 years (longer for anchor tenants, shorter for inline)

**Drafting Notes**:
- Calculate end date carefully (e.g., 5 years from January 1, 2025 = December 31, 2029)
- Consider alignment with fiscal year end for tenant
- Longer terms = stronger tenant negotiating position for concessions

#### 6. COMMENCEMENT DATE
**Purpose**: When rent obligation begins
**Key Elements**:
- Specific date
- May differ from Delivery Date (if fixturing period granted)
- Tenant responsibility for premises readiness
- Tenant must ensure compliance with Laws and building department requirements
- Delay provisions if landlord cannot deliver on time

**Critical Provisions**:
- **Tenant Delay Definition**: Acts/omissions by tenant causing delay
  - Failure to execute lease by deadline
  - Delay in providing deposits, insurance, PAD info
  - Changes to tenant's work plans
  - Tenant contractor delays
- **Landlord Delay Remedy**: Commencement Date postponed day-for-day
- **No Termination**: Lease remains valid despite delay (not "void or voidable")
- **Tenant Readiness**: Tenant responsible to ensure premises compliant with Laws by Commencement Date

**Landlord Perspective**:
- Broad Tenant Delay definition to protect against date slippage
- No landlord liability for delay (except date postponement)
- Tenant still obligated to close even if delivery delayed
- Premises delivered "as is" - tenant's responsibility to make compliant

**Tenant Perspective**:
- Request "outside date" - right to terminate if delivery not by specified date
- Limit Tenant Delay to intentional acts, not minor administrative delays
- Request landlord confirm premises compliant with Laws at delivery
- Consider penalty if landlord delay exceeds certain period (e.g., free rent)

#### 7. BASIC RENT
**Purpose**: Establish base rent payment obligation
**Key Elements**:
- Annual rent by lease year
- Monthly rent (annual ÷ 12)
- Annual rate per square foot
- Payment terms: "monthly in advance"
- Escalation schedule (if applicable)

**Typical Formats**:

**Fixed Steps**:
```
Year 1: $100,000/year = $8,333.33/month = $10.00/sf
Year 2: $103,000/year = $8,583.33/month = $10.30/sf (3% increase)
Year 3: $106,090/year = $8,840.83/month = $10.61/sf (3% increase)
```

**Market Rent Reviews** (uncommon in initial term):
```
Years 1-5: $10.00/sf
Years 6-10: Market Rent as of Year 6 commencement
```

**Indexed Rent** (rare in North America):
```
Base Rent: $10.00/sf
Annual Adjustment: CPI increase (min 0%, max 3%)
```

**Landlord Drafting**:
- Specify exact monthly amounts (avoid rounding disputes)
- State payment due "monthly in advance on 1st day of each month"
- Include late payment interest provisions
- Higher rates in later years to offset time value and concessions

**Tenant Drafting**:
- Request rent escalations capped (e.g., "not to exceed 3% per annum")
- Align rent steps with business cycle if possible
- Understand all-in cost (basic + additional rent)
- Compare rate per square foot to market comparables

**Market Rent Factors** (affecting rate):
- Location and submarket
- Building quality and age
- Unit size (larger = lower $/sf typically)
- Term length (longer = lower rate)
- Lease structure (net vs. gross)
- Market conditions (supply/demand)
- Tenant credit quality

#### 8. ADDITIONAL RENT
**Purpose**: Define tenant's proportionate share of operating costs
**Key Elements**:
- Proportionate Share formula
- Included expenses (operating costs, realty taxes, insurance, utilities, management fee)
- Management fee percentage (typically 3-5%)
- Estimate for current year ("Landlord estimates... to be $X/sf")
- Disclaimer: "estimate is not binding"
- HST/sales tax treatment

**Net Lease Structure** (Standard):
Tenant pays:
1. Base Rent ($/sf)
2. Operating Costs (proportionate share)
3. Realty Taxes (proportionate share)
4. Insurance (proportionate share)
5. Utilities (direct or proportionate share)
6. Management Fee (typically 3-5% of operating costs)

**Proportionate Share Calculation**:
```
Proportionate Share = Rentable Area of Premises ÷ Total Rentable Area of Building

Example:
Premises: 10,000 sf
Building: 100,000 sf
Proportionate Share: 10,000 ÷ 100,000 = 10%

If total operating costs = $500,000
Tenant's share = $500,000 × 10% = $50,000/year = $5/sf
```

**Operating Costs Typically Include**:
- Property management (on-site and off-site)
- Repairs and maintenance (HVAC, roof, structure, parking, landscaping)
- Utilities (common areas: lighting, HVAC, water/sewer)
- Janitorial (common areas)
- Security
- Snow removal and landscaping
- Management fee (3-5% of gross operating costs)
- Administrative costs (accounting, legal, property tax appeals)

**Realty Taxes**:
- Municipal property taxes
- School taxes (where applicable)
- Local improvement charges
- May include property tax consultant fees

**Insurance**:
- Building property insurance (fire, extended coverage, boiler)
- Landlord's liability insurance
- May include earthquake, flood if required by lender

**Utilities**:
- **Separately metered**: Tenant pays directly to utility company
- **Not separately metered**: Proportionate share of building utilities
- Common arrangement: Tenant pays own unit utilities directly; shares common area utilities

**Management Fee**:
- **Multi-tenant buildings**: Typically 5% of building gross revenue
- **Single-tenant (landlord manages)**: Typically 3%
- **Single-tenant (tenant manages)**: Typically 2.75% or lower
- Applied to gross revenue (base rent + additional rent) or operating costs only (varies)

**Estimate Disclaimer**:
Critical clause: "estimate... is not intended by Landlord to be relied upon by Tenant and is not binding and does not impose liabilities on Landlord"
- Landlord not liable if actual costs exceed estimate
- Tenant should request 3-year historical operating statements
- Analyze trend: stable vs. escalating costs

**Tenant Protections to Negotiate**:
1. **Operating Cost Cap**: "Additional Rent shall not increase more than 5% per annum"
2. **Controllable vs. Non-Controllable**: Cap applies only to controllable costs (not taxes/utilities)
3. **Exclusions**: Specifically exclude capital costs, leasing costs, landlord profit items
4. **Audit Rights**: Right to audit landlord's books 1x per year
5. **Reasonable Standard**: Costs must be "reasonable and customary"
6. **Management Fee Cap**: Fix percentage (e.g., "not to exceed 5%")
7. **Gross-Up Provision**: If building not fully occupied, operating costs grossed up to 95% or 100% occupancy

**Landlord Protections**:
1. **Comprehensive Definition**: "Without limitation" language to capture all costs
2. **Flexibility**: Right to change service providers, service levels
3. **Capital Cost Inclusion**: Ability to include capital improvements that reduce operating costs (amortized)
4. **No Cap**: Resist caps on non-controllable costs (taxes, utilities, insurance)
5. **Management Fee on Gross Revenue**: Increases as rent increases

#### 9. LEASE FORMAT
**Purpose**: Establish process for formal lease documentation
**Key Elements**:
- Obligation to execute "Landlord's standard form of lease"
- Landlord delivery timeline: "within 10 business days of mutual acceptance"
- Tenant execution timeline: "within 30 days from date Landlord provides Lease"
- Tenant must execute before taking possession
- Permitted amendments: "reasonable amendments by Tenant for modifications... not specifically provided for"
- Prohibition on material changes: "no modifications shall alter the business or financial basis"
- Net lease confirmation: "completely net lease for Landlord"

**Net Lease Principle**:
Critical language: "Landlord shall not be responsible during the Term for ANY costs, charges, expenses, impositions and outlays of any nature whatsoever arising from or relating to the Building, the Premises, Tenant's occupancy and use... whether foreseen or unforeseen"

**Practical Effect**:
- Landlord insulated from all costs related to premises
- Tenant bears all risks (known and unknown)
- Tenant pays for everything except structural defects in original construction
- Examples: asbestos remediation, mold, HVAC failure, roof replacement, parking lot repaving

**Landlord Perspective**:
- Strong net lease language protects against cost overruns
- Standard form lease minimizes negotiation time
- Timeline pressure on tenant (30 days to execute or lose deal)
- "Business and financial basis" clause prevents tenant from renegotiating core economic terms

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Request lease form upfront**: Review before signing Offer to Lease
- **Document review time**: Negotiate longer execution period (45-60 days) if lease is lengthy/complex
- **Legal review**: Budget time for attorney review
- **Permitted amendments**: Clarify what is "reasonable" - request specific carveouts:
  - Insurance requirements (amounts, coverage types)
  - Assignment/sublease provisions
  - Default notice and cure periods
  - Casualty and condemnation provisions
  - Indemnification scope
- **Pushback on net lease**: Request exceptions for:
  - Structural defects not caused by tenant
  - Building code violations existing at lease commencement
  - Hazardous materials not introduced by tenant

**Common Lease Forms**:
- Landlord proprietary form (institutional landlords)
- Standard form: Retail Council of Canada (retail)
- Standard form: Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)
- Custom negotiated form (large tenants, long terms)

#### 10. METHOD OF PAYMENT
**Purpose**: Establish payment mechanics
**Key Elements**:
- Pre-authorized debit (PAD) required
- Tenant must complete PAD form and provide voided cheque or bank form
- Applies to both Basic Rent and Additional Rent
- Payment on 1st day of each month

**Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD)**:
- Automatic bank withdrawal on specified date
- Reduces landlord collection risk
- Tenant must maintain sufficient funds
- Tenant rights under Canadian Payment Association rules

**Tenant Considerations**:
- Understand PAD rights: can cancel with 30 days notice
- Right to reimbursement for unauthorized debits
- Maintain float in account (rent + estimated additional rent + buffer)
- Monitor for correct amounts debited

**Alternative Payment Methods** (negotiate if PAD not acceptable):
- Online banking bill payment
- Electronic funds transfer (EFT)
- Cheque (typically not preferred by landlord)

#### 11. USE
**Purpose**: Restrict premises use to permitted activities
**Key Elements**:
- Specific use description
- Standard qualifier: "in keeping with first-class industrial/commercial building standards"
- Change requires "Landlord's prior written approval"
- Tenant responsibility: confirm use permitted under applicable Laws
- Tenant must obtain occupancy permit
- No landlord representation regarding permitted use

**Use Clause Spectrum**:

**Narrow (Landlord-Favorable)**:
"Office use only for [specific company name] software development operations"

**Moderate**:
"General office use"
"Warehouse and distribution"

**Broad (Tenant-Favorable)**:
"Any lawful purpose"
"General commercial and industrial uses"

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Broad use = flexibility**: Easier to assign/sublease, adapt to business changes
- **Confirm zoning**: Use clause narrower than zoning = unnecessary restriction
- **Related uses**: Request "and related uses" or "and ancillary uses"
- **Exclusive use**: In retail, negotiate exclusive use (prevent landlord from leasing to competitor)

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Control tenant mix**: Particular concern in retail (tenant mix strategy)
- **Protect other tenants**: May have exclusive use agreements with other tenants
- **Environmental concerns**: Restrict uses involving hazardous materials
- **Insurance concerns**: Certain uses may increase insurance premiums or void coverage
- **Character of building**: Maintain first-class standards

**Due Diligence Disclaimer**:
Critical clause: "Landlord is making no representation or warranty as to Tenant's ability to use the Premises for its intended use"
- Tenant must perform own zoning search
- Tenant must confirm ability to obtain occupancy permit
- Landlord not liable if tenant's use turns out to be prohibited
- **Tenant should verify**: Before signing Offer, confirm with municipal authorities:
  - Zoning permits intended use
  - No additional approvals required (site plan, variances)
  - Occupancy permit obtainable for intended use

#### 12. CONDITION OF PREMISES
**Purpose**: Establish baseline condition at delivery
**Key Elements**:
- "As is, where is" standard
- Tenant accepts premises in current condition
- Only exception: deficiencies in Landlord's Work (if any)
- Deficiency list developed during move-in inspection
- No representation regarding condition, compliance, or fitness for use

**"As Is" Implications**:
- Tenant accepts all defects, deficiencies, and non-compliance
- Tenant responsible to bring premises into compliance with Laws
- Tenant bears cost of any required repairs or upgrades
- Landlord not liable for latent defects

**Landlord's Work Exception**:
If landlord agreed to perform work (see Schedule "C"):
- Landlord must complete work to agreed specifications
- Deficiency list documents incomplete or defective work
- Landlord must remedy deficiencies (typically within 30 days)

**Move-In Inspection**:
Best practice:
1. Landlord and tenant walk premises together at delivery
2. Document condition with photos/video
3. Create punch list of deficiencies
4. Set deadline for remedying deficiencies
5. Both parties sign off on deficiency list

**Tenant Protections to Negotiate**:
1. **Landlord Representation**: "Landlord represents that premises comply with all applicable Laws"
2. **Structural Warranty**: "Landlord warrants building structure, roof, and base building systems in good working order"
3. **Fitness for Use**: "Premises suitable for intended use under Section 11"
4. **Existing Violations**: "No outstanding building, fire, or health code violations"
5. **Hazardous Materials**: "Premises free of hazardous materials not introduced by tenant"

**Landlord Resistance Points**:
- Older buildings: may have deferred maintenance, code violations
- Existing condition: landlord may not know of all issues
- Prior tenant issues: environmental contamination, structural damage
- Cost allocation: landlord wants tenant to bear upgrade costs

**Risk Allocation**:
- **"As Is" with no landlord work**: Tenant bears all risk and cost
- **"As Is" with landlord delivering turnkey**: Landlord bears cost of compliance, tenant bears risk post-delivery
- **Landlord representations**: Landlord bears risk of pre-existing conditions

#### 13. DEPOSIT
**Purpose**: Provide landlord with security for tenant performance
**Key Elements**:
- Total deposit amount
- Breakdown: Last Month's Rent (LMR) + Security Deposit
- LMR calculation: Last month's basic rent + estimated additional rent + HST
- Security deposit: Additional amount (often $3,000-$10,000 or 1-2 months rent)
- Timing: "Upon execution of this Offer"
- Form: Certified cheque payable to landlord
- Forfeiture provision: If tenant breaches before Delivery Date
- Security deposit terms: Held "without interest" per Rent Deposit Agreement (Schedule "D")

**Deposit Structure Example**:
```
Last Month's Basic Rent:        $8,333.33
Last Month's Additional Rent:   $1,666.67 (estimated)
Sub-Total:                      $10,000.00
HST (13%):                      $1,300.00
Security Deposit:               $3,000.00
TOTAL DEPOSIT:                  $14,300.00
```

**Last Month's Rent (LMR)**:
- Applied to final month of term
- If rent increases during term, tenant must top up LMR
- If additional rent estimate changes, landlord may require adjustment
- Typically not refundable (applied to last month) unless term not completed

**Security Deposit**:
- Held as security for tenant's obligations
- Returned at end of term if no defaults
- May be applied against damages, unpaid rent, restoration costs
- Held pursuant to Rent Deposit Agreement (terms specified in lease)

**Landlord Perspective**:
- Larger deposit = better security for tenant performance
- Deposit "without interest" = landlord keeps investment income
- Forfeiture clause = liquidated damages if tenant backs out
- Request multiple months rent for startups, poor credit tenants

**Tenant Perspective**:
- Minimize deposit (cash flow preservation)
- Negotiate interest on security deposit (uncommon but possible)
- Request letter of credit in lieu of cash deposit (preserves credit facility)
- Clarify conditions for return of security deposit
- Automatic return within 30 days of lease expiry if no defaults

**Forfeiture Provision**:
"If Tenant breaks or otherwise violates this Offer to Lease... prior to official Delivery Date, Landlord may be able to keep all or part of this Rent Deposit to cover unpaid rent and/or any damage suffered by Landlord"

**Enforceability**:
- Generally enforceable as liquidated damages
- May be challenged if amount unreasonable (penalty vs. genuine pre-estimate of loss)
- Landlord burden to prove damages if tenant challenges
- Best practice: Landlord mitigate damages (re-lease premises)

**Letter of Credit Alternative**:
Strong tenant may negotiate:
- Irrevocable letter of credit in lieu of cash deposit
- Issued by acceptable financial institution
- Beneficiary: Landlord
- Amount: Equal to deposit
- Term: Duration of lease + 30-60 days
- Landlord can draw upon tenant default
- **Tenant advantage**: Preserves cash, uses credit facility
- **Landlord concern**: More complex to draw upon than holding cash

#### 14. INSURANCE

**Key Elements**:
- Commercial general liability (CGL): Minimum $5 million per occurrence
- All-risks property insurance: Full replacement cost of tenant's property
- Business interruption: Minimum 12 months indemnity

- **Beneficiary**: Loss payable to landlord for rent obligations

**4. Tenant's Legal Liability**:
- **Coverage**: Damage to premises for which tenant is legally liable
- **Amount**: Minimum $1,000,000 per occurrence (replacement cost of premises)
- **Loss of Use**: Minimum 12 months

- **Premises**: "Unit 5 - [Building Name], [Address]"

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Bundle Coverage**: May obtain better rates bundling with other locations
- **Review Requirements Early**: Obtain insurance quote before signing Offer
- **Negotiate Limits**: $5M may be excessive for small office tenant
- **Business Interruption Period**: 12 months may be excessive for quick-recovery business
- **Annual Increases**: Resist "such greater amount as Landlord may from time to time reasonably require"

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Adequate Coverage**: Protects against tenant-caused damages
- **Additional Insured**: Gives landlord direct claim against tenant's insurer
- **Certificate Review**: Confirm before delivery of premises
- **Annual Renewals**: Tenant must provide updated certificates each year
- **No Subrogation**: Ensure mutual waiver of subrogation in place

**Mutual Waiver of Subrogation**:
Standard clause in commercial leases:
- Landlord and tenant each waive claims against the other for property damage
- Applies to damages covered by (or required to be covered by) insurance
- Prevents insurer from suing other party to recover claim payment
- Result: Each party's insurer pays its own insured's claim, no recovery from other party

#### 15. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
**Purpose**: Restrict tenant's use of hazardous materials
**Key Elements**:
- Prohibition on use/storage of Hazardous Substances except listed in lease or approved by landlord
- Must comply with all Environmental Laws
- Tenant must remove non-permitted Hazardous Substances on demand
- Tenant responsible for Hazardous Substances brought by tenant or those under tenant's control
- Remediation obligation: Remove substances that have "become affixed to, permeated or accumulated on or within" structures

3. **Compliance**: Comply with all Environmental Laws
4. **Handling**: Use proper storage, handling, disposal methods
5. **Removal**: Promptly remove upon landlord demand
6. **Remediation**: Clean up any contamination caused by tenant
7. **Indemnification**: Indemnify landlord for environmental claims related to tenant's use

**Environmental Questionnaire (Schedule "E")**:
Detailed questions about:
- Business activities and raw materials used
- Hazardous substances used/generated
- Quantities (monthly/annual)
- Storage methods
- Disposal methods and carriers
- Permits, certificates of authorization required
- Discharges to sewer, water, air
- Pollution control equipment
- Underground/surface storage tanks
- Prevention/emergency plans

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Strict Liability**: Environmental laws impose strict liability (no fault required)
- **Retroactive Liability**: Liable for historical contamination
- **Joint and Several**: Landlord liable even if tenant caused contamination
- **Cost**: Remediation costs can be catastrophic ($100k to $10M+)
- **Lender Requirements**: Lenders require environmental representations

**Landlord Protections**:
1. **Broad Prohibition**: Default is no Hazardous Substances unless approved
2. **Questionnaire**: Obtain detailed information about tenant's operations

4. **Monitoring**: Right to inspect, require reports, require testing
5. **Removal**: Can require immediate removal if risk identified
6. **Indemnification**: Tenant indemnifies landlord for environmental liabilities
7. **Insurance**: Require pollution liability insurance for high-risk tenants
8. **Security**: May require environmental remediation fund or escrow

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Reasonable Use**: Negotiate right to use ordinary office/commercial materials
  - "Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may use ordinary cleaning supplies, toner, copy machine fluids, and other materials customarily used in office operations in reasonable quantities"
- **Approval Standard**: Landlord consent "not to be unreasonably withheld"
- **Limit Remediation Obligation**: Only responsible for contamination caused by tenant, not pre-existing
- **Phase I Environmental Assessment**: Request at lease commencement to establish baseline
- **Questionnaire Review**: Carefully review before completing - represents tenant's operations

**Red Flags for Landlord**:
- Manufacturing operations involving chemicals
- Automotive repair (oil, solvents, paint)
- Dry cleaning (perchloroethylene)
- Printing (solvents, inks)
- Medical/dental (biological waste, mercury)
- Laboratories (various chemicals)
- Underground storage tanks
- Discharge to sewer/water

**Best Practices**:
- **Baseline Assessment**: Phase I Environmental Assessment before lease commencement
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of Hazardous Substances used/disposed
- **Compliance**: Maintain all permits, manifests, disposal records
- **Training**: Train employees on proper handling/disposal
- **Emergency Plan**: Have spill response plan in place
- **Insurance**: Maintain pollution liability coverage if required

#### 16. SIGNAGE
**Purpose**: Control exterior signage and building aesthetics
**Key Elements**:
- Prohibition on exterior signage except as specified
- One building-standard sign permitted
- Location: Above or adjacent to main entry door (per building sign policy)
- Size, design, installation: Per building standard
- Tenant responsible for all costs (supply, install, operate, maintain, insure, taxes)
- Removal obligation: Upon lease expiry/termination, restore façade
- Building directory: Landlord provides listing at landlord's expense

**Signage Rights Spectrum**:

**Minimal (Typical Small Tenant)**:
- Building directory listing only
- Building-standard suite number sign at entrance

**Standard (Offer to Lease Provision)**:
- Building directory listing
- One building-standard exterior façade sign at unit entrance
- Tenant pays all costs

**Enhanced (Large Tenant/Anchor)**:
- Monument sign identification
- Exterior building wall signage (prominent placement)
- Pylon sign (if multi-tenant building with pylon)
- Rooftop sign (rare, major tenants only)

**Building Standard Signage**:
- **Size**: Typically specified (e.g., 24" x 60", 36" x 72")
- **Materials**: Consistent with building (e.g., aluminum, acrylic, LED)
- **Colors**: May be restricted to building color palette
- **Illumination**: May require or prohibit illumination
- **Font**: May specify font families or restrict custom fonts
- **Logo**: Typically permitted within sign area

**Sign Policy/Sign Criteria**:
Landlord typically has detailed sign criteria document covering:
- Approved sign dimensions per unit size
- Approved materials and construction methods
- Approved colors and finishes
- Installation requirements (permits, contractors, insurance)
- Maintenance standards
- Approval process and timing

**Tenant Costs**:
- Design and engineering
- Municipal permit fees
- Fabrication
- Installation (often must use landlord-approved contractor)
- Electrical connection and ongoing hydro
- Insurance (covered under tenant's CGL)
- Property taxes (sign may increase property tax assessment)
- Maintenance, repairs, cleaning
- Removal and restoration at lease end

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Visibility**: Critical for retail, less important for office/industrial
- **Cost**: Budget $3,000-$15,000 for exterior sign (highly variable)
- **Approval Process**: Understand timing (design approval, permit, fabrication = 60-90 days)
- **Restrictions**: Review sign criteria before designing expensive sign
- **Negotiate**:
  - Landlord contribution to sign costs
  - Prominent placement (corner units, high-traffic areas)
  - Larger sign for larger premises
  - Multiple signs if multiple exposures
  - Monument/pylon sign for major tenants

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Aesthetic Control**: Maintain building image and property value
- **Consistency**: All tenant signs should be compatible
- **Approval Rights**: Retain discretion over design, size, placement
- **No Cost**: Tenant pays all costs except directory listing
- **Removal**: Ensure tenant restores facade (otherwise landlord incurs cost)

**Building Directory**:
- Standard amenity: Landlord provides directory listing
- Location: Building lobby or exterior at main entrance
- Landlord expense: Landlord pays for directory and tenant listing
- Building-standard lettering: No special fonts/sizes for individual tenants
- Changes: Tenant may update directory (name change, suite reassignment)

**Municipal Requirements**:
- **Permit**: Almost always required for exterior signage
- **Zoning**: Sign size/type must comply with zoning bylaws
- **Building Code**: Structural requirements for attachment
- **Heritage**: Additional restrictions in heritage districts
- **Timing**: Permit approval 2-8 weeks (varies by municipality)

#### 17. TENANT'S FINANCIALS
**Purpose**: Conduct credit review before lease becomes binding
**Key Elements**:
- Condition precedent: Landlord approval of tenant's creditworthiness
- Information required: 3 years financial statements, interim financials, credit application
- Submission deadline: Within 24 hours of tenant acceptance
- Review period: 10 business days from receipt
- Outcome options:
  - Approval
  - Approval with additional security deposit or guarantee required
  - Deemed termination if landlord doesn't approve or waive within review period
- **Critical**: This is condition precedent for LANDLORD'S benefit

**Financial Information Required**:
1. **Three Years Financial Statements**:
   - Balance Sheet (assets, liabilities, equity)
   - Income Statement (revenue, expenses, net income)
   - Statement of Cash Flows
   - Notes to Financial Statements
   - Ideally audited or review engagement (compiled statements less reliable)

2. **Interim Financial Statements**:
   - Most recent period (e.g., if offer in June, request Q1 or Q2 statements)
   - Shows current financial position vs. year-end statements

3. **Credit Application Form** (Schedule "D"):
   - Corporate information (name, incorporation, principals)
   - Banking references
   - Trade references
   - Litigation history
   - Bankruptcy history
   - Principal's personal net worth (for small/private companies)

**Landlord Credit Analysis**:
Key metrics:
1. **Liquidity Ratios**:
   - Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities (target: >1.5)
   - Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities (target: >1.0)

2. **Leverage Ratios**:
   - Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Total Equity (target: <2.0)
   - Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income ÷ Debt Service (target: >1.25)

3. **Profitability**:
   - Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue
   - Net Margin = Net Income ÷ Revenue
   - EBITDA and EBITDA trends

4. **Rent Affordability**:
   - Rent as % of Revenue (typically <8-10% acceptable)
   - Rent Coverage = EBITDA ÷ Annual Rent (target: >3x)

**Red Flags**:
- Negative equity (liabilities exceed assets)
- Negative cash flow from operations
- Declining revenue trend (3-year decline)
- Net losses (especially multi-year losses)
- High debt-to-equity (overleveraged)
- Contingent liabilities (lawsuits, guarantees)
- Going concern notation (auditor concern re: viability)
- Related party transactions (may indicate cash extraction)

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Approved**: Proceed with lease on terms in Offer
2. **Approved with Conditions**:
   - Additional security deposit (e.g., 3-6 months rent)
   - Personal or corporate guarantee from principals
   - Letter of credit
   - Prepayment of several months rent
3. **Not Approved**: Offer terminates, neither party has further obligations

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Essential Due Diligence**: Don't lease to insolvent tenant
- **10 Business Days**: Sufficient time for analysis
- **Conditions**: Be prepared to articulate additional security required
- **Negotiation**: May negotiate modified terms (shorter term, higher rent, more security) vs. outright rejection

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **24-Hour Deadline**: Unreasonably tight - negotiate 3-5 business days
- **Confidentiality**: Require landlord to keep financials confidential, not share with third parties
- **Limited Distribution**: Landlord may only share with lender/partners if necessary for approval
- **Alternative Evidence**: If financials are weak, provide additional evidence:
  - Strong personal net worth of principals
  - Guarantee from parent company
  - Prepayment of several months rent
  - Business plan showing improvement trajectory
  - Customer contracts/backlog demonstrating revenue
- **Negotiating Leverage**: If tenant knows financials are weak, address proactively:
  - Offer guarantee upfront
  - Offer additional security deposit
  - Offer shorter term with renewal option (prove performance)

**Guarantee Considerations**:
If landlord requires guarantee:
- **Personal Guarantee**: Individual(s) personally liable for tenant's lease obligations
- **Corporate Guarantee**: Parent company guarantees subsidiary tenant
- **Limited vs. Unlimited**: Limited to specific amount or time period vs. unlimited
- **Continuing**: Survives lease amendments, renewals
- **Joint and Several**: If multiple guarantors, each liable for full amount (not split)

**Typical Guarantee Terms**:
- Guarantor liable for all rent, additional rent, damages, costs
- Guarantor waives notice of default
- Guarantor cannot assert tenant defenses
- Guarantor liable even if lease amended without guarantor consent
- Guarantor liable even if landlord delays enforcement against tenant

**Guarantee Negotiation** (Tenant/Guarantor Perspective):
- **Burnoff**: Guarantee terminates after X years if no defaults (e.g., "after 3 years of timely performance")
- **Cap**: Limit guarantee to specific amount (e.g., "maximum $250,000")
- **Carveout**: Not liable for certain obligations (e.g., "excluding environmental liabilities")
- **Notice**: Require landlord to notify guarantor of tenant default (allows guarantor to cure or take action)

#### 18. LANDLORD APPROVAL REQUIRED
**Purpose**: Allow landlord time for senior management/ownership approval
**Key Elements**:
- Condition precedent: Approval from landlord's senior management
- Approval period: 10 business days from final execution by tenant
- Outcome: Approval, waiver, or automatic termination if no written notice
- **Critical**: This is condition precedent for LANDLORD'S benefit

**Purpose of Clause**:
- Leasing agent may not have authority to bind landlord
- Landlord ownership/management wants to review all deals
- Large landlords may have investment committee approval required
- Landlord may have lender/partner consent requirements

**Timing**:
- "From final execution of this Offer by Tenant"
- Clock starts when tenant signs (not when landlord signs)
- 10 business days (excludes weekends, holidays)

**Outcome**:
- **Approval**: Landlord notifies tenant in writing "approved" - deal proceeds
- **Waiver**: Landlord notifies tenant waiving this condition - deal proceeds
- **No Notice**: If landlord fails to notify within 10 business days, Offer "automatically null and void"

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Risk**: Deal not firm until landlord approves
- **Timing**: Cannot rely on deal for business planning until approval obtained
- **Mitigate**: Request landlord obtain internal approvals before issuing Offer
- **Alternative**: Reverse structure - make Offer contingent on landlord execution (landlord doesn't sign until approved)
- **Negotiation**: Shorten period to 5 business days
- **Certainty**: If tenant needs certainty, require Offer not be issued until landlord internally approved

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Protect Agent**: Allows agent to issue offers without full authority
- **Review Time**: Gives investment committee time to review
- **Flexibility**: Can back out if terms not acceptable to senior management
- **No Liability**: If not approved, no liability to tenant ("null and void")

**Interplay with Tenant Financials Condition**:
Often both conditions present:
1. Tenant submits financials (24 hours)
2. Landlord reviews financials (10 business days)
3. Landlord senior management approves (10 business days)

**Concurrent vs. Sequential**:
- **Concurrent**: Both 10-day periods run simultaneously from tenant signature
- **Sequential**: Senior management period runs after financials approved (20 business days total)
- **Ambiguous Drafting**: If Offer doesn't clarify, interpret using contra proferentem (against drafter)

**Practical Approach**:
- Landlord agent should obtain internal approval before issuing Offer whenever possible
- Reduces uncertainty for tenant
- Avoids wasted time negotiating Offer that won't be approved
- Faster path to executed lease

#### 19. CONFIDENTIALITY
**Purpose**: Protect proprietary deal information
**Key Elements**:
- Prohibition on disclosure of financial or other terms
- Applies to both landlord and tenant
- Exceptions:
  - Professional advisers, consultants, auditors
  - As required by law (e.g., court order, securities disclosure)

**Rationale**:
- **Landlord**: Doesn't want other tenants to know terms (rent, concessions, TI allowances)
- **Tenant**: Doesn't want competitors to know terms
- **Market**: Prevents information from becoming public knowledge

**Scope of Confidentiality**:
Prohibited disclosures:
- Rent rate ($/sf)
- Rent escalations
- Additional rent estimates
- Rent-free periods
- Leasehold improvement allowances
- Security deposits
- Any other financial or business terms

**Permitted Disclosures**:
1. **Professional Advisers**:
   - Lawyers
   - Accountants
   - Real estate consultants
   - Business advisers

2. **Consultants**:
   - Architects/engineers (for tenant's work)
   - Contractors (for pricing tenant's work)
   - Lenders (for financing)

3. **Auditors**:
   - External auditors (for financial statement purposes)
   - Internal auditors

4. **As Required by Law**:
   - Public company securities disclosure
   - Court order or subpoena
   - Government regulatory requirement
   - Freedom of information request (for government tenants)

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Lender Disclosure**: Ensure can disclose to lender (if financing)
- **Parent Company**: Ensure can disclose to parent company (if subsidiary)
- **Buyer**: If tenant may sell business, ensure can disclose to prospective buyers (under NDA)

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Lender/Partner Disclosure**: Ensure can disclose to lender and equity partners
- **Prospective Buyer**: Can disclose to prospective purchasers of property (under NDA)
- **Appraiser**: Can disclose to appraisers for valuation purposes

**Public Disclosure**:
- Some tenants/landlords are public companies (securities disclosure requirements)
- Material leases may require public disclosure in financial statements or MD&A
- Confidentiality clause doesn't override legal disclosure obligations

**Breach Consequences**:
- Breach of contract claim
- Damages = harm caused by disclosure (often hard to quantify)
- Injunctive relief (court order preventing further disclosure)
- Liquidated damages (if specified in clause)

**Enhanced Confidentiality** (negotiate if highly sensitive):
- Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) separate from Offer to Lease
- More detailed restrictions and remedies
- Survival post-termination (confidentiality obligations survive even if deal doesn't close)

#### 20. H.S.T. (Harmonized Sales Tax)
**Purpose**: Clarify that stated amounts exclude sales tax
**Key Elements**:
- All amounts quoted exclude HST
- Amounts are "subject to HST if applicable"
- Alternative: "or any other equivalent tax" (covers future tax changes)

**Canadian Sales Tax Context**:

**Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)**:
- Federal GST + Provincial sales tax combined
- **Ontario**: 13% (5% federal + 8% provincial)
- **New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, PEI**: 15%

**GST Only**:
- **Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon**: 5% GST only (no provincial sales tax)

**GST + PST** (Separate):
- **British Columbia**: 5% GST + 7% PST = 12% total
- **Manitoba**: 5% GST + 7% PST (RST) = 12% total
- **Quebec**: 5% GST + 9.975% QST = 14.975% total
- **Saskatchewan**: 5% GST + 6% PST = 11% total

**Commercial Real Estate Rent**:
- **Taxable**: Commercial rent subject to GST/HST
- **Tenant Pays**: Tenant pays GST/HST in addition to rent
- **Input Tax Credit (ITC)**: Commercial tenant typically recovers GST/HST as ITC
- **Net Effect**: Tenant recovers HST if business is GST/HST registrant (usual for commercial tenants)

**Rent Example (Ontario - 13% HST)**:
```
Basic Rent:          $10,000.00/month
HST (13%):           $1,300.00
Total Payment:       $11,300.00
Tenant ITC:          ($1,300.00) - recovered on GST return
Net Cost to Tenant:  $10,000.00
```

**When HST Not Recoverable** (Tenant Perspective):
- **Exempt Supplies**: If tenant provides exempt supplies (e.g., certain healthcare, education)
- **Non-Registrant**: If tenant not GST/HST registrant (rare for commercial)
- **Partial Eligibility**: If tenant has both taxable and exempt sales (pro-rata ITC)

**Operating Costs and HST**:
- **Additional Rent**: Operating costs subject to HST
- **Pass-Through**: Some operating costs may not include HST (e.g., property taxes)
- **Landlord Recovers**: Landlord recovers HST paid on operating expenses as ITC
- **Charges to Tenant**: Landlord charges HST on Additional Rent

**Security Deposit and HST**:
- **Deposit**: Security deposit generally not subject to HST when paid
- **Application**: If applied to rent, HST applicable at that time
- **Refund**: If refunded, no HST

**Landlord Obligations**:
- **GST/HST Registration**: Must be registered for GST/HST
- **Charge and Collect**: Must charge GST/HST on rent
- **Remit**: Must remit to CRA (less ITCs)
- **Invoice**: Must provide proper GST/HST invoices to tenant

**Tenant Obligations**:
- **Pay**: Must pay GST/HST on rent
- **ITC**: Claim ITC on GST/HST return (if eligible)
- **Documentation**: Maintain invoices for ITC claims

**Future Tax Changes**:
"Or any other equivalent tax" clause protects against:
- Changes to HST/GST rates
- New federal or provincial taxes
- Replacement of HST/GST with different consumption tax

#### 21. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE
**Purpose**: Make all time deadlines strict and binding
**Key Elements**:
- "Time is of the essence"
- Applies to all matters with prescribed time periods
- Failure to meet deadline = breach of contract

**Legal Effect**:
- **Strict Compliance**: Deadlines must be met exactly
- **No Extensions**: Missing deadline by one day = breach (no automatic grace period)
- **Material Breach**: Failure to meet deadline may give other party right to terminate
- **Cure**: Late performance may not cure breach (depends on circumstances)

**Common Time Periods in Offer to Lease**:
1. Tenant financial submission: 24 hours
2. Landlord financial review: 10 business days
3. Landlord senior management approval: 10 business days
4. Offer acceptance deadline: Specific date/time
5. Landlord delivery of lease: 10 business days from mutual acceptance
6. Tenant execution of lease: 30 days from receipt
7. Delivery Date: Specific date
8. Commencement Date: Specific date

**Consequences of Missed Deadlines**:
- **Tenant Misses Financial Submission**: Landlord may terminate Offer
- **Landlord Misses Review Period**: Condition deemed waived or Offer terminates (depending on clause)
- **Tenant Misses Lease Execution Deadline**: Landlord may terminate Offer; may forfeit deposit
- **Landlord Misses Delivery Date**: Commencement Date postponed; tenant may have termination right (if provided)

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Ensure Compliance**: Calendar all deadlines immediately upon execution
- **Buffer Time**: Build in buffer before deadlines
- **Extensions**: If need extension, request in writing before deadline
- **Acknowledge**: Even if other party misses deadline, acknowledge to avoid waiver arguments

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Enforce Strictly**: Exercise termination rights if tenant misses deadlines
- **Document**: Document missed deadlines contemporaneously
- **Waiver Risk**: If don't enforce one deadline, may be deemed to have waived "time is of essence"

**Calculating Time Periods**:
- **Business Days**: Exclude weekends and statutory holidays
- **Calendar Days**: Include all days
- **Computation**: Clarify if period starts day after event or same day
  - Example: "10 business days from receipt" - does day of receipt count?
  - Best practice: Specify "from and excluding" or "from and including"

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Tenant assumes lease execution deadline is soft (it's not with "time is of essence")
- Landlord provides lease on day 15, tenant thinks has 30 days from then (may have already expired)
- Parties assume weekends extend deadline (not if "calendar days")

#### 22. EXECUTION
**Purpose**: Facilitate remote execution of Offer
**Key Elements**:
- May execute in counterparts (each party signs separate copy)
- Counterparts together constitute one instrument
- Electronic or facsimile execution permitted
- Electronic/fax signatures binding

**Counterparts**:
- Traditional: All parties sign same physical document
- Counterparts: Each party signs separate copy (same form)
- Legal effect: Separate copies together constitute single agreement
- Benefit: Don't need to physically exchange documents

**Electronic Execution**:
- Email PDF signature page
- Electronic signature platforms (DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
- Fax transmission of signature page (less common now)

**Best Practices**:
1. **Exchange**: After signing, exchange executed copies (each party gets copy with all signatures)
2. **Dating**: Ensure agreement dated (may be different from signature dates)
3. **Binding**: Binding when both parties have executed and delivered (may argue delivery = transmission)

**Statute of Frauds**:
- Real property leases >3 years must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Electronic signatures satisfy "in writing" requirement
- Digital/fax copies satisfy signature requirement

#### 23. SCHEDULES
**Purpose**: List all schedules that form part of Offer
**Key Schedules**:
- **Schedule "A"**: Outline Plan of Premises (floor plan showing premises)
- **Schedule "B"**: Special Provisions (additional terms not in main body)
- **Schedule "C"**: Landlord's Work and Tenant's Work (construction obligations)
- **Schedule "D"**: Credit Application Form
- **Schedule "E"**: Environmental Questionnaire
- **Schedule "F"**: Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD) Authorization

**Importance**:
- Schedules are part of Offer (incorporated by reference)
- Must be attached when Offer executed
- Tenant should review all schedules carefully (not just main Offer)

#### 24. INDEMNIFIER (Guarantee)
**Purpose**: Provide landlord with additional security through personal or corporate guarantee
**Key Elements**:
- Named individual or entity as guarantor ("Indemnifier")
- Guarantee all tenant obligations:
  - Payment of rent, additional rent, all other amounts
  - Performance of all tenant covenants
  - Indemnification for losses from tenant default
- Guarantee applies to initial term AND all renewals/extensions
- Burnoff provision: Release after 3rd anniversary if preconditions met
- Preconditions:
  - All rent paid on time
  - All obligations performed
  - Never been in default
  - (Banking/mail errors don't trigger failure)

**Guarantee Scope**:
Guarantor liable for:
- All Rent (Basic + Additional)
- Loan repayments (if Landlord financed TI)
- All other amounts due under lease
- Performance of all tenant covenants
- Damages from tenant defaults
- Costs of enforcement (legal fees, collection costs)

**Continuing Guarantee**:
- "Continuing" = applies throughout lease term including renewals
- Survives amendments to lease
- Not discharged by landlord's delay in enforcement
- Not discharged by landlord's dealings with tenant

**Joint and Several**:
If multiple guarantors:
- Each liable for 100% of obligations (not split)
- Landlord may pursue one, some, or all guarantors
- Guarantors may have right to seek contribution from co-guarantors

**Burnoff Provision**:
Purpose: Incentivize tenant performance, limit guarantor long-term exposure

**Preconditions** (all must be met):
1. **Payment Performance**: Paid all Rent and other sums on time
2. **Covenant Performance**: Performed each and every obligation
3. **No Defaults**: Never been in default (even if cured)
4. **Time Period**: Measured as of 3rd anniversary of Commencement Date

**Banking Error Exception**:
"Tenant's failure to timely pay rent solely as a result of a banking error or mail delay shall not be considered a breach of the Preconditions"
- Protects against technical defaults outside tenant's control
- **Burden of Proof**: Tenant must prove delay was "solely" due to banking error or mail delay
- **Examples**: Bank processing delay, cheque lost in mail, PAD processing error

**Effect of Burnoff**:
If Preconditions met:
- Guarantor released from obligations arising AFTER 3rd anniversary
- Guarantor still liable for obligations arising BEFORE 3rd anniversary (even if claimed later)
- Example: If environmental contamination occurred in Year 2 but discovered Year 5, guarantor still liable

If Preconditions NOT met:
- Guarantor remains fully liable throughout entire term including all renewals
- No second chance for burnoff
- One strike rule

**Guarantor Perspective**:
- **Three Years**: Long period of perfect performance required
- **No Defaults**: Even cured defaults prevent burnoff
- **All Obligations**: Must perform ALL covenants (maintenance, insurance, reports, etc.), not just pay rent
- **Renewals**: If no burnoff, liable for all renewal terms (could be 10-20 years total)
- **Negotiate**:
  - Shorter burnoff period (e.g., 2 years)
  - More lenient standard: "no material defaults" vs. "never been in default"
  - Permit cured defaults: "no uncured defaults"
  - Exclude minor/technical defaults from burnoff test
  - Cap guarantee amount even if burnoff not achieved

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Strict Standard**: Perfect performance standard incentivizes tenant compliance
- **Three Years**: Sufficient time to assess tenant's reliability
- **All Renewals**: If burnoff not achieved, guarantee continues (protects landlord for long-term leases)
- **Banking Error Exception**: Reasonable to exclude technical glitches
- **No Partial Burnoff**: Either full burnoff or no burnoff (no middle ground)

**Execution**:
- Guarantor must sign Offer to Lease
- Guarantor signature requirements:
  - If individual: Witness signature
  - If corporation: Two officers (typically)
  - Authority representation: "I have authority to bind"

#### 25. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
**Purpose**: Establish that Offer contains all terms of parties' agreement
**Key Elements**:
- No covenants, representations, warranties except as expressly set forth
- No collateral agreements
- Binding on parties, assigns, heirs, executors, nominees
- Subject to conditions precedent (Sections 17, 18)
- Governed by laws of [Province]
- Parties attorn to [Province] courts
- No registration in Land Titles Office

**Entire Agreement Clause Effect**:
- **Integration**: All terms integrated into written Offer
- **No Oral Terms**: Oral representations not enforceable
- **No Implied Terms**: No terms implied beyond what's written
- **Supersedes**: Supersedes all prior negotiations, discussions, correspondence

**Practical Effect**:
- **Tenant Cannot Rely On**: Oral promises by landlord's leasing agent
  - "Don't worry, we won't enforce that clause"
  - "We'll give you more TI allowance if needed"
  - "You can assign the lease easily"
- **Get It In Writing**: All terms tenant relies on must be in Offer or Lease

**Collateral Agreements**:
Clause states "no collateral agreements"
- Sometimes parties have side letters or separate agreements
- If so, entire agreement clause should carve out: "except as set forth in [describe side agreement]"

**Binding Effect**:
- Binds parties and successors
- **Assigns**: If tenant assigns lease, assignee bound by Offer terms incorporated in Lease
- **Heirs/Executors**: If individual tenant/guarantor dies, estate bound
- **Nominees**: Tenant can nominate related entity to be tenant (if lease permits)

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**:
- **Governing Law**: Substantive law that interprets contract
  - "Laws of the Province of Ontario"
  - Includes statutes and common law
- **Jurisdiction**: Which courts have authority to hear disputes
  - "Parties attorn to Courts of Ontario"
  - Both parties submit to jurisdiction (no forum shopping)
- **Default**: If not specified, usually law of jurisdiction where property located

**No Registration**:
- "Neither this Offer nor any claim based on it shall be registered in any Land Titles Office"
- **Purpose**: Prevent Offer from clouding title to property
- **Lease Registration**: Formal Lease typically IS registered (or Notice of Lease)
- **Breach**: Tenant registration of Offer may be breach (landlord can seek removal)

#### 26. END OF OFFER
**Purpose**: Clarify relationship between Offer and Lease
**Key Element**:
- "This Offer terminates on the date upon which the Lease has been executed and delivered between the parties"
- Once Lease executed, Offer no longer relevant (terms merged into Lease)

**Merger Doctrine**:
- Terms of Offer "merge" into Lease
- After Lease executed, only Lease governs
- Offer no longer enforceable separate from Lease
- Exception: If Offer contains terms not in Lease, may argue those terms survive

**Practical Importance**:
- **Review Lease Carefully**: Ensure all Offer terms incorporated into Lease
- **Comparison**: Compare Offer and Lease before signing Lease
- **Discrepancies**: If Lease omits or contradicts Offer terms, raise before signing
- **Amendment**: If Lease doesn't match Offer, amend Lease or re-negotiate

**Common Discrepancies**:
- Rent-free period in Offer not reflected in Lease
- TI allowance amount differs
- Option to renew terms differ
- Parking spaces quantity differs
- Use clause narrower than Offer

**Tenant Protection**:
- Review Lease against Offer
- Reconcile all terms
- Request amendments before signing Lease
- If material discrepancy, may refuse to execute and cite Offer as governing

## SCHEDULE "B" - SPECIAL PROVISIONS

**Purpose**: Address terms requiring more detail than main Offer
**Common Special Provisions**:

- **Operating Costs**: Not billed (landlord pays)
- **Realty Taxes**: Not billed (landlord pays)

**Benefit to Tenant**:
- 2-month fixturing period = 2 months free rent (approximately)
- Allows tenant to invest capital in improvements while rent not yet due
- Reduces cash flow pressure at lease commencement

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Cost**: Foregoes 2 months rent
- **Risk**: If tenant abandons, landlord incurs gap before re-leasing
- **Trade-Off**: May charge higher rent to recoup fixturing period cost
- **Control**: Retains access to complete landlord's work

**Bankruptcy Clause**:
"However, if the Lease is disclaimed pursuant to Section 65.2(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act... Tenant's obligation to pay Rent with respect to the Premises for the whole of the Fixturing Period will be deemed to have been reinstated effective as of the day before the effective date of the disclaimer"

**Purpose**:
- BIA Section 65.2 allows bankrupt tenant to disclaim lease with 3 months rent payment
- This clause deems fixturing period as part of term (not rent-free) if tenant bankrupt
- Effect: Tenant in bankruptcy owes rent for fixturing period + 3 months (not just 3 months)

**Application**:
- Only applies if tenant bankrupt AND disclaims lease
- Unlikely scenario but protects landlord's interest
- Mirrors logic: if tenant got benefit of fixturing period, should pay rent for it if bankrupt

### 3. Basic Rent-Free Period
**Purpose**: Provide tenant with operating cost period (but no basic rent) as concession
**Key Terms**:
- **Condition Precedent**: Required Conditions must be met
- **Period**: Specific dates (often immediately after Fixturing Period ends)
- **Rent Relief**: Basic Rent abated
- **Other Obligations**: All other terms apply:
  - Operating Costs (tenant pays)
  - Realty Taxes (tenant pays)
  - Additional Rent (utilities, insurance, etc.) (tenant pays)
  - Maintenance, insurance, liability, indemnification
- **Revocation**: If Required Conditions not met, rent-free period voids (tenant owes rent retroactively)
- **Bankruptcy Reinstatement**: If Lease disclaimed, Basic Rent obligation reinstated for rent-free period

**Basic Rent-Free vs. Fixturing Period**:

| **Fixturing Period** | **Basic Rent-Free Period** |
|---|---|
| Before Commencement Date | After Commencement Date |
| No Basic Rent, Operating Costs, Taxes | No Basic Rent, but tenant pays Operating Costs and Taxes |
| Non-exclusive access (landlord present) | Exclusive possession (tenant in business) |
| Tenant constructing improvements | Tenant operating business |

**Typical Structure**:
```
Delivery Date:            April 1, 2025
Fixturing Period:         April 1 - May 31, 2025 (2 months, free)
Commencement Date:        June 1, 2025
Basic Rent-Free Period:   June 1 - August 31, 2025 (3 months)
Full Rent Starts:         September 1, 2025
```

**Total Concession**:
- 2 months fixturing (free): ~$20,000 value (basic + additional rent)
- 3 months rent-free: ~$30,000 value (basic rent only)
- Total: ~$50,000 value over 5-year term

**Tenant Benefit**:
- Reduces cash flow burden during startup/transition period
- Allows tenant to generate revenue before full rent kicks in
- Particularly valuable for new businesses or businesses ramping up operations

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Negotiating Tool**: Rent-free periods used to win tenants in competitive markets
- **Recapture**: Higher rent in later years to recoup rent-free period
- **Effective Rent**: Analyze net effective rent (total rent over term ÷ term length)
- **Risk**: If tenant defaults early, landlord loses rent-free concession value

**Net Effective Rent Calculation**:
```
Gross Rent:               $10/sf × 10,000 sf × 5 years = $500,000
Rent-Free:                3 months = $25,000
Net Rent:                 $500,000 - $25,000 = $475,000
Net Effective Rent:       $475,000 ÷ 5 years ÷ 10,000 sf = $9.50/sf

Market compares based on Net Effective Rent, not Face Rent
```

**Required Conditions Importance**:
If tenant:
- Assigns lease (violates Required Condition a)
- Defaults on payment (violates Required Condition c)
- Goes bankrupt (violates Required Condition d)

Then: Rent-free period voids retroactively. Tenant owes Basic Rent for entire rent-free period.

Example:
- Tenant got 3 months rent-free (June-August, $25,000 value)
- Tenant defaults in November
- Landlord terminates lease
- Landlord claims $25,000 for rent-free period as damages

**Bankruptcy Reinstatement**:
Same as Fixturing Period - if lease disclaimed in bankruptcy, Basic Rent deemed owed for rent-free period

### 4. Option to Extend (Renewal Option)
**Purpose**: Grant tenant right (but not obligation) to extend lease term
**Key Terms**:
- **Condition Precedent**: Required Conditions must be met
- **Number of Options**: Typically 1 or 2 (e.g., "one (1) further term of five (5) years")
- **Extension Term Length**: Same as initial term or shorter (e.g., 5+5, 5+5+5, 10+5+5)
- **Same Terms**: All lease terms continue except:
  - No further renewal options (or reduced - e.g., 2 options initially, 1 option after first renewal)
  - Basic Rent = Market Rent or prior year rent, whichever greater
  - No TI allowance, rent-free period, or other inducements
  - Premises accepted "as is"
- **Notice Deadline**: 9-12 months before expiry (strict deadline)
- **Notice Window**: Between 12 months and 9 months before expiry (e.g., "not earlier than 12 months, not later than 9 months")
- **Market Rent**: Defined; determined by agreement or expert determination if no agreement
- **Minimum Rent**: Greater of Market Rent or prior year Basic Rent (prevents rent decrease)

**Exercise Requirements**:
1. **Required Conditions**: All must be met at time of exercise and continuously through to Extension Term commencement
2. **Timely Notice**: Notice within specified window
3. **Form of Notice**: Written notice to landlord

**Notice Timing Example**:
```
Current Term Expiry:      December 31, 2030
Notice Window Opens:      January 1, 2030 (12 months before expiry)
Notice Deadline:          March 31, 2030 (9 months before expiry)
Extension Term:           January 1, 2031 - December 31, 2035 (if 5-year option)
```

**Market Rent Definition**:
"Market Rent means the annual rental which could reasonably be obtained by Landlord for the Premises from a willing tenant or willing tenants dealing at arms' length with Landlord in the market prevailing for a term commencing on the commencement date of the Extension Term, having regard to all relevant circumstances including the size and location of the Premises, the facilities afforded, the terms of the lease thereof (including its provisions for Additional Rent), the condition of the Premises and the extent and quality of the improvements therein"

**Market Rent Assumptions**:
- Existing improvements are "ideal for Tenant's use as is" (disregard Tenant's trade fixtures)
- Disregard deficiencies in condition caused by Tenant's failure to maintain
- Highest and best use (irrespective of actual permitted use)
- Consider rentals in Building and comparable buildings
- **Net Result**: Market Rent = what Landlord could get from third-party tenant for premises as-is with existing improvements

**Market Rent Determination Process**:

**Step 1 - Agreement** (Deadline: 3 months before expiry):
- Landlord and Tenant negotiate Market Rent
- If agree, Market Rent established
- Document agreement in writing

**Step 2 - Expert Determination** (if no agreement):
- Either party appoints expert (real estate appraiser)
- Other party has 15 days to approve or name alternative expert
- If no agreement on expert, either party can apply to court to appoint
- Expert must be qualified: education, experience, training in real estate valuation; 5+ years in municipality

**Step 3 - Expert Decision** (30 days from appointment):
- Expert determines Market Rent
- Expert does not receive evidence from parties (independent assessment)
- Expert reviews market data, comparable rentals, property characteristics
- Decision is "conclusive and binding" and "not subject to appeal"

**Costs**: Borne equally by Landlord and Tenant

**Interim Rent**:
"In the event that the Basic Rent payable during the Extension Term has not been determined prior to commencement of the Extension Term, then until such determination has been made, Tenant shall pay Basic Rent at a rate equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Basic Rent payable during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Extension Term"

**Purpose**:
- Ensures Tenant pays rent while Market Rent being determined
- 150% protects Landlord against low-ball offers by Tenant
- Upon determination: reconciliation (Landlord refunds excess or Tenant pays deficiency)

**Example**:
```
Prior Year Rent:          $100,000/year
Extension Term Starts:    January 1, 2031 (Market Rent not yet determined)
Interim Rent:             $150,000/year ($12,500/month)
Market Rent Determined:   $120,000/year (March 15, 2031)
Reconciliation:           Tenant paid $37,500 (Jan-Mar at $12,500/month)
                          Should have paid $30,000 (Jan-Mar at $10,000/month)
                          Landlord refunds $7,500
```

**Amendment Agreement**:
"At Landlord's option, within ten (10) business days following determination of the Basic Rent payable for the Extension Term, Tenant shall execute an agreement, prepared by Landlord, amending the provisions of the Lease to incorporate the Extension Term into the Lease and to give effect to the foregoing"

**Purpose**: Document Extension Term formally; amend Lease to reflect new term and rent

**Tenant Perspective**:

**Value of Option**:
- **Flexibility**: Can stay or leave at end of term
- **Below Market**: If market rent declines or remains flat, option valuable
- **Business Continuity**: Avoids forced relocation
- **Negotiating Leverage**: Option = less urgent need to negotiate (stronger position)

**Key Negotiation Points**:
- **Notice Timing**: Request shorter advance notice (6 months vs. 12 months)
- **Notice Window**: Request wider window or no window (any time up to 6 months before expiry)
- **Market Rent Floor**: Resist "greater of Market Rent or prior year rent" (should be able to benefit from rent decline)
- **Tenant Improvements**: Request TI allowance for renewal term (landlord typically resists)
- **Expert Determination**: Ensure expert criteria and process fair
- **Multiple Options**: Request 2 or 3 renewal options (first-generation space = longer occupancy)

**Landlord Perspective**:

**Value of Granting Option**:
- **Tenant Commitment**: Longer potential occupancy
- **Reduced Vacancy**: Higher probability of continuous occupancy
- **Reduced Costs**: Avoid leasing commissions, TI for new tenant
- **Predictability**: Know tenant for longer period

**Key Protections**:
- **Required Conditions**: Ensures only good tenants can renew
- **Market Rent**: Ensures rent adjusts to market (not locked in at below-market rate)
- **Minimum Rent**: Protects against rent decrease (prior year rent floor)
- **No Concessions**: No TI, rent-free periods in renewal (save those for new tenant negotiations)
- **As Is**: Tenant accepts premises in current condition (no landlord work)
- **Early Notice**: 9-12 months notice allows landlord to market space if tenant doesn't renew

**Market Practice**:
- **Industrial/Office**: 1-2 renewal options common (5+5, 10+5+5)
- **Retail**: Longer renewals common for anchor tenants (10+10+10)
- **Rent**: Market Rent typical; occasionally fixed percentage increases if market tight

**Option vs. Right of First Offer**:
- **Option**: Tenant can renew at Market Rent (landlord must extend)
- **Right of First Offer**: Landlord must offer to tenant before marketing to third parties (tenant can accept or decline)
- **Right of First Refusal**: If landlord gets third-party offer, must give tenant chance to match

### 5. Leasehold Improvement Allowance (TI Allowance)
**Purpose**: Landlord contributes to cost of tenant's improvements
**Key Terms**:
- **Amount**: $X per square foot of Rentable Area (e.g., "$25/sf × 10,000 sf = $250,000")
- **Condition Precedent**: Required Conditions must be met
- **Application**: Applied against cost of Tenant's Work
- **Payment Timing**: Within 60 days after last to occur of:
  - Lease execution
  - Commencement Date
  - Tenant opens for business in entire premises
  - Tenant provides paid invoices ≥ TI Allowance
  - Tenant provides project manager certificate of value of work
- **Evidence Required**: Copies of paid invoices and project manager certificate
- **Lien Compliance**: No liens registered; comply with Construction Lien Act holdbacks
- **Expiry**: If not requested within first 12 months of Term, allowance extinguished
- **Setoff**: Landlord may deduct amounts Tenant owes Landlord
- **Self-Payment**: Landlord may pay itself or Tenant's contractors directly
- **Clawback**: If Tenant defaults or bankrupt, unamortized portion immediately due as Additional Rent
- **Security Interest**: Landlord has security interest in Tenant's property securing clawback

**Payment Conditions** (Last to Occur):
Complex structure ensures Tenant:
1. Executed Lease
2. Term commenced (rent flowing)
3. Actually opened for business in whole premises
4. Spent ≥ TI Allowance
5. Provided proof of payment and value

**Purpose**: Prevent tenant from collecting TI allowance then abandoning lease

**Evidence Required**:
1. **Paid Invoices**: Copies showing:
   - Invoice from contractor/supplier
   - Description of work/materials
   - Amount
   - Payment proof (cancelled cheque, wire transfer confirmation, credit card receipt)
   - Total ≥ TI Allowance

2. **Project Manager Certificate**: Letter from Tenant's project manager stating:
   - Value of work completed to date
   - Work conforms to approved plans
   - Lien holdbacks satisfied
   - No outstanding claims

**Lien Compliance**:
- **Construction Lien Act** (Ontario) or equivalent: Requires holdback of 10% for 45 days after substantial completion
- Landlord won't pay TI Allowance until lien period expires (protects against liens attaching to landlord's property)
- Tenant must provide statutory declarations, lien waivers from contractors

**12-Month Expiry**:
"If Tenant does not request payment from Landlord of the Leasehold Improvement Allowance within the first Twelve (12) months of the Term, the Leasehold Improvement Allowance will be extinguished"

**Purpose**:
- Ensures Tenant completes improvements promptly
- Allows Landlord to close books on TI allowance
- Prevents Tenant from claiming allowance years later

**Practical Effect**:
- Tenant must complete improvements within ~10 months of Commencement (allow 2 months for documentation and payment processing)
- If Tenant delays improvements, risks losing allowance

**Setoff Rights**:
"Landlord shall have the right to deduct from the Leasehold Improvement Allowance all amounts which are owing to Landlord by Tenant for any reason whatever relating to the Premises or the Project"

**Examples**:
- Unpaid rent or additional rent
- Late fees or interest
- Landlord's costs to repair Tenant damage
- Unpaid utilities

**Self-Payment**:
"Landlord shall have the right to pay itself or any other contractor of Tenant any amounts payable in respect of any of Tenant's Work, and it is agreed that any such deduction or payment by the Landlord shall constitute a payment on account of Landlord's obligation to pay the Leasehold Improvement Allowance"

**Purpose**:
- Protects Landlord if Tenant not paying contractors (risk of liens)
- Allows Landlord to pay contractors directly
- Ensures TI Allowance actually used for improvements (not diverted by Tenant)

**Clawback Provision**:
"If Tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent... or the Lease is terminated prior to the expiration of the Term by reason of a default by Tenant, then... the unamortized portion of the Leasehold Improvement Allowance calculated from the Commencement Date on the basis of an assumed rate of depreciation on a straight line basis to zero over the initial Term of this Lease shall immediately become due and payable to the Landlord as Additional Rent"

**Example**:
```
TI Allowance:             $250,000
Term:                     10 years
Amortization:             $25,000/year
Tenant Default:           Year 4
Unamortized:              $250,000 - (4 × $25,000) = $150,000
Tenant Owes:              $150,000 immediately due
```

**Purpose**:
- Landlord investment in TI to induce long-term tenant occupancy
- If Tenant leaves early, Landlord hasn't recouped investment
- Clawback allows Landlord to recover unamortized portion

**Security Interest**:
"Tenant hereby grants to Landlord an immediately attaching security interest in all of Tenant's present and after-acquired personal property situated on the Premises, including, without limitation, all trade fixtures, chattels, equipment and Tenant's interest in the Leasehold Improvements"

**Purpose**:
- Secures Tenant's obligation to repay unamortized TI Allowance
- Gives Landlord priority over other creditors (if perfected under Personal Property Security Act)
- Allows Landlord to seize Tenant's property to satisfy debt

**Perfection**:
- Landlord should register financing statement under PPSA
- Registration gives Landlord priority over unsecured creditors
- In Tenant bankruptcy, Landlord has secured claim to Tenant's property (up to unamortized TI amount)

**Tenant Perspective**:

**Negotiate**:
- **Higher Allowance**: Market rate for TI allowances varies by property type and market:
  - Office: $10-40/sf depending on condition
  - Industrial: $5-15/sf (less finish required)
  - Retail: $20-60/sf (high-finish requirements)
- **Faster Payment**: Request payment in stages as work progresses (not lump sum at end)
- **Longer Claim Period**: Request 18-24 months to claim (not 12 months)
- **Eliminate Clawback**: Request no clawback or shorter amortization period (5 years vs. 10 years)
- **No Security Interest**: Resist PPSA security interest

**Alternatives**:
- **Cash Allowance**: Landlord pays cash at lease commencement (risky for landlord - rarely granted)
- **Rent Reduction**: Lower rent in lieu of TI allowance (better for cash-poor tenant)
- **Landlord Builds**: Landlord constructs improvements per Tenant's specs (turnkey) - see "Landlord's Work - Turnkey" alternative

**Landlord Perspective**:

**Risk Management**:
- **Conditions**: Strict conditions ensure Tenant actually occupies and operates before payment
- **Evidence**: Require proof Tenant actually spent money (not just estimates)
- **Lien Protection**: Don't pay until lien period expires
- **Expiry**: 12-month window encourages prompt completion
- **Clawback**: Protects investment if Tenant defaults early
- **Security Interest**: Provides recourse in bankruptcy

**Economics**:
- TI Allowance = inducement to attract tenant
- Landlord recoups through higher rent over term
- Net Effective Rent analysis includes TI allowance cost

### 6. Parking
**Purpose**: Grant tenant right to use parking spaces
**Key Terms**:
- **Condition**: Tenant not in default
- **Ratio Parking**: X stalls per 1,000 sf of Rentable Area (e.g., "3 per 1,000 sf")
- **Calculation**: 10,000 sf × 3 per 1,000 sf = 30 parking spaces
- **Type**: Unreserved (not assigned, first-come first-served)
- **Additional Parking**: Month-to-month parking spaces (e.g., 6 additional spaces)
- **Termination**: Landlord may terminate month-to-month spaces on 30 days notice
- **Monthly Parking**: Parking spaces above ratio on month-to-month basis
- **Cost**: Landlord's standard rate (e.g., $75/month/space + HST)
- **Payment**: Monthly in advance whether or not used
- **Rate Changes**: Landlord may adjust rates (typically annually)

**Ratio Parking**:
- Included as part of lease
- Cannot be terminated by landlord (tied to lease term)
- Typical ratios:
  - **Office**: 3-4 per 1,000 sf
  - **Industrial**: 2-3 per 1,000 sf (less employee density)
  - **Retail**: Varies widely (1-5 per 1,000 sf depending on use)

**Month-to-Month Parking**:
- Additional spaces beyond ratio
- Landlord may terminate on 30 days notice
- Useful if Tenant needs extra parking but Landlord wants flexibility

**Unreserved vs. Reserved**:
- **Unreserved**: Not assigned to specific tenant; first-come first-served in general parking area
- **Reserved**: Assigned space(s) for specific tenant (typically extra cost or reserved for executive parking)

**Parking Cost**:
- May be included in operating costs (less common)
- More commonly: separate charge per space (as in this provision)
- Market rates: $50-150/month/space depending on market and location

**Tenant Perspective**:
- **Sufficient Ratio**: Ensure ratio sufficient for employee/customer parking needs
- **Include in Operating Costs**: Negotiate to include parking in operating costs (no separate charge)
- **Fixed Rate**: Negotiate fixed parking rate (not subject to landlord's discretion)
- **Reserved Parking**: Request reserved spaces for executives/customers (better tenant experience)
- **Guest Parking**: Clarify guest/visitor parking arrangements (often separate from tenant parking)

**Landlord Perspective**:
- **Flexibility**: Month-to-month parking for spaces above ratio allows re-allocation if new tenant needs parking
- **Revenue**: Parking fees = additional revenue stream
- **Rate Adjustments**: Retain right to adjust rates (parking costs increase - maintenance, snow removal, re-surfacing)
- **No Guarantee**: If unreserved, no guarantee spaces available (though practically, ratio should ensure availability)

### 7. Brokerage Fees
**Purpose**: Clarify commission arrangements
**Two Alternatives**:

**Alternative 1 - Commission Payable**:
"Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree, that Tenant has retained [Brokerage Name] as its registered real estate brokerage. Landlord agrees to pay [Brokerage Name] an industry standard commission, payable as follows: (i) 50% upon execution of the Lease in a form acceptable to Landlord; and (ii) 50% on the Commencement Date"

- **Tenant's Broker**: Tenant engaged broker
- **Landlord Pays**: Industry standard (Landlord typically pays both landlord and tenant brokers)
- **Amount**: "Industry standard" (typically 4-6% of total rent over term, split between brokers)
- **Payment Terms**: Split payment (50% at lease execution, 50% at commencement)
- **Risk**: If Tenant defaults before commencement, Landlord paid 50% of commission for nothing

**Alternative 2 - No Broker**:
"Tenant represents and warrants that it has not engaged any real estate broker or agent to act on its behalf with respect to this Lease transaction and that Landlord shall not be responsible for the payment of any fee, commission or any other compensation with respect to this Lease transaction. Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any and all claims with respect thereto, unless Landlord has given a specific written mandate to any broker or agent for the present transaction"

- **No Broker**: Tenant represents no broker involved
- **Landlord Not Liable**: Landlord not responsible for any commission
- **Indemnity**: Tenant indemnifies Landlord if broker claims commission
- **Exception**: Unless Landlord gave written mandate to broker

**Practical Effect**:
- Protects Landlord from surprise commission claims
- If Tenant engaged broker without disclosing, Tenant liable for commission
- If broker claims commission, Tenant indemnifies Landlord

**Industry Standard Commission**:
- Typically 4-6% of total base rent over initial term
- Example: $10/sf × 10,000 sf × 5 years = $500,000 total rent × 5% = $25,000 commission
- Split between landlord's broker and tenant's broker (often 50/50, but varies)
- Renewal commissions typically lower (1-2% of renewal term rent)

**Tenant Perspective**:
- If engaged broker, ensure disclosed in Offer
- Ensure commission arrangement doesn't inflate rent (landlord may increase rent to cover commission cost)
- If no broker, include Alternative 2 to protect against claims

**Landlord Perspective**:
- Factor commission cost into deal economics
- Split payment reduces risk if tenant defaults before commencement
- Ensure broker has executed listing agreement or buyer representation agreement (protects against disputes)

## SCHEDULE "C" - LANDLORD'S WORK AND TENANT'S WORK

**Purpose**: Define construction obligations of each party
**Two Alternatives**:

### Alternative 1 - "As Is" Delivery (Landlord Minimal Work)

**Landlord's Work**:
- Deliver premises "as is, where is"
- Clean, broom-swept, free of debris/furniture
- All systems in good working order: lighting, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, doors
- **Note**: Landlord will not commence until Lease executed

**Substantially Complete Definition** (typically in Lease):
- Work complete except for minor deficiencies
- Premises suitable for Tenant's use
- Occupancy permit obtainable (if required)

**Tenant Delay**:
- If Landlord's Work not complete by Commencement Date due to Tenant Delay or other reason:
  - No delay in Commencement Date
  - Lease not void/voidable
  - Landlord not liable
  - Tenant permits Landlord access to complete work
  - Tenant not entitled to rent abatement

**Tenant's Work**:
- ALL other work required to complete premises for Tenant's use
- At Tenant's sole cost
- Requirements:
  - Good and workmanlike manner
  - Contractors approved by Landlord in advance
  - Plans and specs professionally prepared and approved by Landlord before commencing
  - If connecting to base building systems, Landlord may require use of Landlord's contractors
  - If concurrent work, Tenant's contractors subordinate to Landlord's contractors
  - Tenant obtains all permits and licenses, including close-out documents
  - Tenant pays any landlord fees or charges attributable to Tenant's Work
  - Tenant pays for additional building services during construction (after-hours HVAC, extra security, etc.)
  - Tenant ensures no liens registered

### Alternative 2 - "Turnkey" Delivery (Landlord Builds Tenant's Improvements)

**Landlord's Work**:
- List specific base building work Landlord will complete (e.g., roof repairs, HVAC upgrades, etc.)

**Tenant's Improvements** (built by Landlord):
- "Landlord shall be responsible for constructing Tenant's improvements in the Premises, including without limitation, the partitions, finishes and ceilings (collectively, 'Tenant's Improvements') in accordance with the plan and specifications mutually agreed upon between Landlord and Tenant"

**Landlord's Contribution**:
- "Landlord shall be responsible for the cost of Tenant's Improvements up to a maximum cost of $X per square foot of the Rentable Area of the Premises, plus H.S.T. ('Landlord's Contribution')"
- Example: $30/sf × 10,000 sf = $300,000 Landlord's Contribution

**Cost Overrun**:
- "If the Cost of Tenant's Improvements... exceeds Landlord's Contribution, then the amount incurred by Landlord in respect of the Cost of Tenant's Improvements in excess of Landlord's Contribution shall be paid by Tenant within five (5) days of written request by Landlord together with receipted invoices therefore"
- Failure to pay within 5 days = Tenant Delay (postpones Delivery Date and Commencement Date)

**Cost of Tenant's Improvements Definition**:
- All costs relating to contracts and subcontracts for labour and material
- Demolition expenses
- Permit fees
- Insurance costs, utility costs
- All third-party costs and fees: architectural, engineering, design, supervision
- Legal and accounting fees
- **Landlord's management fee**: X% of cost of Tenant's Improvements (typically 5-10%)

**Clawback** (similar to TI Allowance):
- If Tenant bankrupt or defaults, unamortized portion of Landlord's Contribution immediately due as Additional Rent
- Straight-line amortization over initial term
- Security interest in Tenant's property

**Turnkey Advantages (Tenant)**:
- **Single Point of Responsibility**: Landlord manages construction
- **Speed**: Landlord may have established contractors, faster permitting
- **Quality**: Landlord controls quality (protects building systems)
- **Financing**: Tenant doesn't need to finance construction upfront

**Turnkey Disadvantages (Tenant)**:
- **Cost**: Landlord may charge premium (management fee, markup on contractors)
- **Control**: Less control over contractor selection, materials, schedule
- **Cost Overruns**: Tenant bears risk of cost overruns over Landlord's Contribution

**Turnkey Advantages (Landlord)**:
- **Control**: Landlord controls construction quality, protects building systems
- **Speed**: Landlord can start construction before Lease executed (conditional on execution)
- **Tenant Credit Risk**: Reduced risk of Tenant abandoning partially-built space

**Turnkey Disadvantages (Landlord)**:
- **Cost Risk**: If construction costs exceed estimate, Landlord may bear overrun (if Tenant doesn't pay)
- **Liability**: Landlord liable for construction defects (though can seek recourse from contractors)
- **Schedule**: Landlord responsible for delivering on time (though Tenant Delay provisions mitigate)

## When to Use Offers to Lease vs. LOI vs. Term Sheet

### Offer to Lease
**Use When**:
- Ready to commit to binding agreement
- Terms fully negotiated and agreed
- Transaction straightforward (no unusual conditions)
- Want deal certainty quickly
- Tenant credit known and acceptable

**Don't Use When**:
- Terms still being negotiated
- Significant conditions precedent uncertain (zoning, permits, financing)
- Tenant credit unknown (do LOI with condition for financial review)
- Complex transaction requiring detailed lease drafting and negotiation

### Letter of Intent (LOI)
**Use When**:
- Preliminary stage (testing interest, establishing framework)
- Want to secure exclusivity while negotiating details
- Tenant credit or business model needs vetting
- Transaction complex (multi-phased, development required, etc.)
- Want to negotiate key terms before investing in legal drafting

**Key Provisions to Make Binding in LOI**:
- Confidentiality
- Exclusivity (no-shop) for defined period
- Cost responsibility (who pays legal, brokerage, due diligence costs)
- Deposit treatment if deal doesn't close
- Good faith negotiation obligations

### Term Sheet
**Use When**:
- Very preliminary discussions
- Documenting agreed business points before Offer/LOI
- Internal approvals needed (document terms for approval process)
- Multiple parties involved (document consensus)
- Fast-moving transaction (quick alignment on key terms)

## Best Practices

### For Landlords

1. **Standard Form**: Develop and use standard Offer to Lease template
2. **Credit Check**: Always require financial review before making binding offer
3. **Conditions Precedent**: Use landlord approval condition to allow senior management review
4. **Protect Downside**: Robust Tenant Delay definition, strict no-liability language
5. **Net Lease**: Strong net lease language to insulate from costs
6. **Clawbacks**: Include clawback provisions for all concessions (TI, rent-free, fixturing)
7. **Option to Renew**: If granted, ensure market rent with minimum rent floor
8. **Required Conditions**: Use Required Conditions to protect valuable tenant rights
9. **Document Delivery**: Deliver Lease promptly (within 10 business days) to maintain momentum
10. **Execution Deadline**: Enforce tenant lease execution deadline strictly

### For Tenants

1. **Review Carefully**: Read entire Offer including all schedules before signing
2. **Legal Review**: Have lawyer review before execution (especially first-time tenants)

   - Longer execution period for lease
   - More tenant-favorable renewal options
   - Higher TI allowances
7. **Understand Deposits**: Understand deposit is at risk if you back out after signing
8. **Calendar Deadlines**: Calendar all deadlines immediately upon execution (time is of essence)
9. **Premises Inspection**: Inspect premises before signing (understand "as is" condition)
10. **Build Buffer**: Allow adequate fixturing period for tenant's work (don't underestimate time required)

### For Both Parties

## Red Flags

### For Landlords
- Tenant hesitant to provide financial statements
- Tenant requests unusual terms (e.g., landlord structural warranties, unlimited assignability)
- Tenant's use involves high environmental risk
- Tenant requests short-term lease with multiple renewals (option to leave, not commitment)
- Tenant wants possession before Lease executed
- Tenant proposes business model that's untested or failing in market

### For Tenants
- Landlord won't provide lease form for review before Offer execution
- Landlord's operating cost estimate significantly below market (may be low-balling)
- "As is" delivery with no landlord's work but premises in poor condition
- Very short tenant lease execution deadline (pressure tactic)
- Landlord approval condition with very long review period (deal uncertainty)
- High deposit relative to rent (may indicate landlord concerned about tenant credit)
- Landlord resists standard tenant protections (assignment provisions, exclusive use, non-disturbance)

## Common Mistakes

### Landlord Mistakes
1. **Vague Premises Description**: Leads to disputes about what premises includes
2. **Incomplete Landlord's Work**: Failure to clearly define landlord's work obligations
3. **Weak Tenant Delay Definition**: Tenant can delay without consequence
4. **No Clawback**: Tenant gets concessions then defaults early
5. **Loose Required Conditions**: Tenant can transfer lease and retain valuable options
6. **No Credit Review**: Lease to insolvent tenant
7. **Failure to Enforce Deadlines**: Waives "time is of essence"

### Tenant Mistakes
1. **Signing Without Legal Review**: Miss important unfavorable terms
2. **Inadequate Fixturing Period**: Can't complete tenant's work before rent starts
3. **Ignoring Operating Cost Estimate**: Doesn't budget for full occupancy cost
4. **Not Verifying Zoning**: Signs lease then discovers use not permitted
5. **Accepting "As Is" Without Inspection**: Discovers major deficiencies after taking possession
6. **Missing Renewal Notice Deadline**: Loses option to renew
7. **Underestimating Tenant's Work Cost**: Budget shortfall, can't open on time
8. **Not Understanding Net Lease**: Surprised by repair and maintenance obligations
