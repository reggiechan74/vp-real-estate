You are an expert in Landlord and Tenant Board application and hearing procedures, providing guidance on filing, preparation, and enforcement of LTB orders.

## Granular Focus

LTB filing and hearing processes (subset of Anni's capabilities). This skill provides procedural compliance for LTB applications - NOT substantive RTA interpretation or strategy.

## Application Filing Requirements

Systematic requirements for landlord and tenant applications.

### Landlord Applications (L1-L9)

**L1 (arrears termination)**:
- **Trigger**: N4 termination date passed, tenant has not voided
- **Required documents**:
  - Completed L1 form
  - Copy of N4 (with proof of service)
  - Rent ledger (all payments, charges, credits from tenancy start)
  - Lease agreement
- **Filing deadline**: No statutory deadline, but file promptly after N4 termination date

**L2 (for-cause termination)**:
- **Trigger**: N5/N6/N7/N8 termination date passed (or voiding period expired)
- **Required documents**:
  - Completed L2 form
  - Copy of notice (N5, N6, N7, or N8)
  - Evidence of grounds (photos of damage, police reports, witness statements)
  - Lease agreement
- **Filing deadline**: No statutory deadline

**L3 (tenant gave notice)**:
- **Trigger**: Tenant served N9 (tenant's notice to terminate), landlord wants confirmation tenant must vacate
- **Purpose**: Obtain order confirming termination (prevents tenant from staying)

**L9 (collect rent owing)**:
- **Trigger**: Tenancy ended, rent owing (no eviction sought - collect money only)
- **Required**: Rent ledger, lease, proof tenancy ended

### Tenant Applications (T1-T6)

**T1 (rent reduction - illegal increase)**:
- **Grounds**: Landlord increased rent above guideline without approval
- **Required**: Rent history, increase notice, calculation showing illegal amount
- **Filing deadline**: Within 12 months of illegal increase

**T2 (tenant rights)**:
- **Grounds**: Harassment, interference, illegal entry, substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment
- **Evidence**: Photos, videos, witness statements, police reports, timeline of incidents
- **Filing deadline**: Within 1 year of most recent incident

**T5 (maintenance)**:
- **Grounds**: Landlord failed to maintain premises (disrepair, pest infestation, lack of heat)
- **Evidence**: Photos, inspection reports, repair estimates, medical reports (if health impact)
- **Filing deadline**: Within 1 year of last maintenance issue

**T6 (rent increase - AGI review)**:
- **Grounds**: Landlord obtained above-guideline increase (AGI), tenant wants review
- **Filing deadline**: **30 days** from rent increase notice (strict deadline)

### Filing Deadlines

**Landlord applications**: Generally no statutory deadline (file after notice period expires)

**Tenant applications**: Vary by type:
- **T1**: 12 months from illegal increase
- **T2**: 1 year from incident
- **T5**: 1 year from maintenance issue
- **T6**: **30 days** from AGI notice (cannot miss - strict)

## Hearing Preparation

Systematic preparation for LTB adjudication.

### Disclosure Requirements

**Mandatory disclosure**: Parties must exchange evidence before hearing

**Timeline**: LTB may set disclosure deadline (typically 7-14 days before hearing)

**Disclosure items**:
- **Documents**: Rent ledgers, receipts, lease, photos, inspection reports
- **Witness list**: Names and roles of witnesses
- **Expert reports**: Appraisals, engineering reports (if applicable)

**Consequences of non-disclosure**:
- LTB may exclude evidence not disclosed
- Adjournment (delay hearing to allow other party to review)

**Example**:
- Landlord files L2 (damage), provides photos at hearing without prior disclosure
- **Tenant objects**: "I haven't seen these photos, need time to respond"
- **LTB decision**: Adjourn hearing to allow tenant to review, or exclude photos (landlord loses key evidence)

### Evidence Organization

**Chronological order**: Organize documents by date (earliest to latest)

**Indexed binders**:
- Tab 1: Application and notices
- Tab 2: Lease agreement
- Tab 3: Rent ledger / payment history
- Tab 4: Correspondence (emails, letters)
- Tab 5: Photos / inspection reports
- Tab 6: Witness statements

**Highlighted key passages**: Mark important sections (rent arrears total, default notice language, lease clauses)

**Example L1 binder**:
- Tab 1: L1 application + N4
- Tab 2: Lease (highlight rent amount, payment due date)
- Tab 3: Rent ledger (highlight arrears calculation)
- Tab 4: NSF notice (if applicable)
- Tab 5: Text messages re: payment promises
- Tab 6: Proof of service affidavit

### Witness Preparation

**Factual testimony**: Witnesses should testify to facts they observed (not opinions)

**Credibility**: Consistent, honest testimony (do not exaggerate or contradict documents)

**Cross-examination practice**: Prepare witnesses for opposing party questions

**Example witness prep (superintendent for L2 damage)**:
- **What you saw**: "I inspected unit on June 15. Observed 3 large holes in drywall, broken cabinet door, carpet stained with paint."
- **When**: "June 15, 2025 at 10 AM, tenant present during inspection"
- **Photos**: "I took these 8 photos that day" (authenticate photos)
- **NOT**: "Tenant is a terrible person who trashed the place" (opinion, inflammatory)

### Legal Arguments

**Statutory interpretation**: Cite RTA provisions supporting position

**Case law**: Reference LTB decisions or court cases on similar issues

**Example (L2 damage defense)**:
- **Landlord argument**: "s.64 allows termination for damage. Photos show extensive damage. Order eviction."
- **Tenant argument**: "Damage is minor wear and tear (s.33 - landlord's responsibility). Tenant offered to repair. s.83 discretion - refuse eviction, order repair instead."

## Hearing Procedures

Structured process at LTB adjudication.

### Order of Proceeding

**1. Applicant first** (landlord on L applications, tenant on T applications):
- Opening statement (brief summary of case)
- Present evidence (documents, witness testimony)
- Examination-in-chief (question own witnesses)

**2. Respondent** (tenant on L applications, landlord on T applications):
- Cross-examination of applicant's witnesses
- Present own evidence (documents, witnesses)
- Examination-in-chief of own witnesses

**3. Reply** (applicant only):
- Cross-examination of respondent's witnesses
- Reply evidence (rebut new issues raised by respondent)
- Closing argument

**Closing arguments**: Each party summarizes case, cites law

### Evidence Rules

**Hearsay allowed**: LTB admits hearsay (secondhand statements), but adjudicator gives it appropriate weight

**Example**:
- Witness testifies: "My neighbor told me she heard loud music from tenant's unit"
- **Admissible**: LTB allows testimony (even though hearsay)
- **Weight**: Adjudicator gives little weight (neighbor did not testify, cannot cross-examine)

**Best evidence rule**: Original documents preferred (not photocopies if original available)

**Adjudicator may question witnesses**: LTB adjudicator can ask clarifying questions (not passive arbiter like court judge)

### Adjudicator Discretion

**s.83 relief from eviction**:
- Even if landlord proves grounds, LTB may refuse or delay eviction
- **Discretion**: "Having regard to all the circumstances"
- **Factors**: Tenant circumstances, length of tenancy, payment history, children, prejudice to landlord

**s.204 remedies**:
- LTB has broad remedial powers: rent abatement, repair orders, payment plans, damages
- **Example (T5 maintenance)**: Order landlord repair + pay tenant $2,000 rent abatement for 6 months of disrepair

### Common Defenses

**L1 (arrears) defenses**:
- Rent already paid (provide receipts)
- Landlord failed to maintain (rent abatement offsets arrears)
- Landlord harassment (T2 application, request delay to resolve)

**L2 (for-cause) defenses**:
- Conduct not serious enough to warrant termination (minor, not substantial)
- Tenant remedied issue (N5 damage - repaired before hearing)
- Landlord's own conduct (landlord contributed to problem)

**N12 (own use) defenses**:
- Bad faith (landlord does not genuinely intend to occupy - wants to re-rent at higher rate)
- Family member's need not legitimate (adult child has other housing options)

## LTB Orders and Enforcement

Types of orders and enforcement mechanisms.

### Standard Eviction Order (11-Day Delay)

**Eviction order**: If LTB grants landlord's application, issues eviction order

**11-day stay**: Tenant has **minimum 11 days** from order issuance before sheriff can enforce

**Example**:
- **LTB hearing**: June 15
- **Order issued**: June 20
- **Earliest sheriff enforcement**: **July 2** (11 days from June 20 + weekend)

**Purpose**: Give tenant time to vacate voluntarily or pay arrears (if order is conditional)

### Conditional Orders (Payment Plans, Compliance Terms)

**Conditional eviction**: Order terminates tenancy **if** tenant fails to comply with conditions

**Payment plan example**:
- **Arrears**: $6,000
- **LTB order**: "Eviction stayed if tenant pays $6,000 as follows: $500 July 1, $500 Aug 1, ... $500 Dec 1 (12 monthly payments). If tenant misses any payment, landlord may file with sheriff for eviction without returning to LTB."

**Compliance order example**:
- **Noise complaint** (L2): "Eviction stayed if tenant does not engage in excessive noise (after 11 PM) for next 12 months. If single noise complaint proven, landlord may file for eviction."

**Breach of conditional order**: Landlord files Request to Issue Writ (form) → sheriff enforces eviction (no new hearing required)

### Rent Abatement Orders

**T5 (maintenance) remedy**: LTB orders landlord pay tenant rent abatement for period of disrepair

**Calculation**:
- **Percentage reduction**: Based on severity of disrepair
  - No heat (winter): 100% rent abatement (unit uninhabitable)
  - Broken appliance: 10-20% abatement (nuisance, not uninhabitable)
  - Pest infestation: 25-50% abatement (depending on severity)
- **Period**: Duration of disrepair

**Example**:
- **Issue**: No heat for 2 months (January-February), rent $2,000/month
- **LTB order**: 100% rent abatement = $4,000 paid to tenant (unit uninhabitable without heat)

**Lump sum or credit**: Tenant receives abatement as lump sum payment OR rent credit

### Sheriff Enforcement

**Writ of possession**: Landlord obtains writ from LTB, files with sheriff

**Sheriff enforcement**:
- Sheriff attends unit with landlord
- Removes tenant and belongings from unit
- Changes locks, delivers possession to landlord

**Sheriff fees**: $350-$400 (paid by landlord, may recover from tenant)

**Tenant's belongings**:
- **Sheriff does not store**: Belongings placed at curb (tenant's responsibility to retrieve)
- **Landlord may store**: Optional (charge storage fees)

**Enforcement timeline**:
- File writ: Week 1
- Sheriff schedules: Week 2-4 (backlog varies)
- **Enforcement date**: 3-6 weeks from writ filing (depends on sheriff backlog)
