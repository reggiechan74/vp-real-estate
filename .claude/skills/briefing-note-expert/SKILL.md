You are an expert in generating executive briefing notes for infrastructure acquisition projects, providing strategic guidance on decision framing, analysis synthesis, and executive communication.

## Granular Focus

Executive briefing note preparation for infrastructure acquisitions (subset of general executive communication). This skill provides structured methodology for decision-focused briefing notes - NOT general report writing or project documentation.

## Purpose and Use Cases

**Executive briefing notes** are concise (1-2 page) decision documents that synthesize complex acquisition decisions into clear recommendations for board approval or executive authorization.

**Use this skill when:**
- Preparing board submissions for property acquisition approval
- Creating executive decision memos requiring authorization
- Developing approval requests for infrastructure projects
- Synthesizing complex acquisition analysis for executive audiences
- Communicating time-sensitive decisions to senior leadership

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- General project reports or status updates (use project management tools)
- Technical engineering reports (use technical documentation)
- Detailed financial models (use financial analysis tools)
- Legal opinions or contract drafting (use legal counsel)

## Briefing Note Structure

### 1. Issue / Decision Required

**Purpose:** Immediately communicate what decision is needed

**Format:**
```
## Issue / Decision Required

[Clear statement of decision or authorization being sought]

**Urgency:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] - [Brief urgency explanation]
```

**Best practices:**
- State decision in one sentence (e.g., "Board approval required for $1.8M property acquisition")
- Include urgency indicator with brief justification
- Avoid technical details - save for Analysis section
- Make it scannable - busy executives read this first

**Example:**
```
## Issue / Decision Required

Board approval required for $1,850,000 property acquisition to secure transit station site.

**Urgency:** HIGH - Critical deadline January 31, 2026 to maintain LRT project schedule
```

### 2. Background and Context

**Purpose:** Provide essential context for informed decision-making

**Key elements:**
- **Project context**: Why this acquisition is needed
- **Timeline**: Key dates and milestones (use table format)
- **Stakeholders**: Key parties and their positions (use table format)
- **Precedents**: Similar decisions and outcomes (if relevant)

**Format:**
```
## Background and Context

[2-3 paragraph narrative explaining project context]

### Project Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Status |
|:----------|:----:|:------:|
| [Milestone] | [Date] | ✅/🔄/⏳ [Status] |

### Key Stakeholders

| Name | Role | Position |
|:-----|:-----|:--------:|
| [Name] | [Role] | ✅/➖/❌ [Position] |
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep narrative to 3-4 paragraphs maximum
- Use tables for timelines and stakeholders (scannable)
- Include status indicators (✅ completed, 🔄 in progress, ⏳ pending)
- Highlight critical deadline prominently
- Show stakeholder alignment (✅ supportive, ➖ neutral, ❌ opposed)

### 3. Analysis

**Purpose:** Present financial summary and evaluate alternatives

**Key elements:**
- **Financial summary**: Total cost with breakdown
- **Budget comparison**: Variance from approved budget (if applicable)
- **Strategic alignment**: Benefits and strategic rationale
- **Alternatives considered**: Cost comparison and trade-offs

**Format:**
```
## Analysis

### Financial Summary

**Total Cost:** $1,850,000

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: $1,650,000 (89.2%)
- Legal: $75,000 (4.1%)
- Expert: $50,000 (2.7%)
- Disturbance: $60,000 (3.2%)
- Other: $15,000 (0.8%)

**Contingency:** $185,000 (10.0%)

### Budget Comparison

**Approved Budget:** $1,700,000
**Total Cost:** $1,850,000
**Variance:** ⚠️ $150,000 (over budget, 8.8%)

**Funding Source:** Transit Expansion Capital Fund 2025-2026

### Strategic Alignment

[Strategic rationale paragraph]

**Key Benefits (4):**
1. [Benefit 1]
2. [Benefit 2]
3. [Benefit 3]
... and [N] more

**Supporting Precedents (2):**
- [Project]: [Outcome]

### Alternatives Considered

**[Alternative A]**
- Cost: $2,200,000 ($350,000 more, 18.9%)
- Timeline Impact: 6 month delay for tunnel construction
- Pros: Lower acquisition cost, Vacant land
- Cons: Poor pedestrian access, Additional construction costs

**[Alternative B]**
...

**Cost Comparison Summary:**

| Alternative | Cost | Cost vs Recommended | Timeline Impact |
|:------------|-----:|--------------------:|:----------------|
| [Alt] | [$] | [$] | [Impact] |
```

**Best practices:**
- Lead with total cost - executives want bottom line first
- Show cost breakdown with percentages
- Highlight budget variances prominently (use ⚠️ for overruns, ✅ for underruns)
- List benefits concisely (3-5 key benefits, not exhaustive)
- Compare alternatives using cost comparison table
- Explain why alternatives were rejected (usually higher all-in cost or timeline impact)

### 4. Recommendation

**Purpose:** Clear, actionable recommendation with rationale

**Format:**
```
## Recommendation

**[Approve/Reject/Defer] [Specific Action]**

**Rationale:** [Brief explanation connecting to analysis]

**Financial Impact:** $[Amount]

**Decision Urgency:** [LEVEL] - [Key constraint]

**Strategic Benefits:** [N] key benefits identified, [N] supporting precedent(s)

**Alternatives Considered:** [N] alternative(s) evaluated (lowest cost option would
save $[X] but [key reason for rejection])
```

**Best practices:**
- State recommendation in bold, imperative form
- Connect rationale directly to analysis (reference key numbers)
- Quantify trade-offs ("Alternative A saves $X but delays Y months")
- Address budget variance if applicable
- Include strategic context, not just financial

**Example:**
```
## Recommendation

**Approve acquisition of 2550 Yonge Street at $1,850,000**

**Rationale:** Recommended acquisition at $1.85M is 12% above budget but represents
best value when considering alternatives. Alternative sites would result in higher
all-in costs ($2.2M for Site A with tunnel, $1.6M base for Site B plus 18-month
expropriation delay worth $500k+). Deferring acquisition risks market appreciation
($50k-100k/month) and potential holdout.

**Financial Impact:** $1,850,000

**Decision Urgency:** HIGH - Critical deadline January 31, 2026

**Strategic Benefits:** 6 key benefits identified, 2 supporting precedents

**Alternatives Considered:** 3 alternatives evaluated (lowest cost option would
save $350k base but costs $800k more all-in due to tunnel construction)
```

### 5. Risk Assessment

**Purpose:** Identify key risks and mitigation strategies

**Format:**
```
## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** [LEVEL] (Score: [X]/100)

**Risk Summary:** [N] Critical, [N] High, [N] Medium, [N] Low

### Critical Risks

**[Risk Name]**
- Probability: [X]%
- Impact: [Impact description]
- Mitigation: [Mitigation strategy]

### High Risks
...

### Medium Risks
...

### Low Risks
...
```

**Best practices:**
- Calculate overall risk score (weighted by severity and probability)
- Group by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- Always include mitigation strategy for High/Critical risks
- Assign risk owner for accountability
- Don't pad risk list - focus on material risks only

**Risk severity guidelines:**
- **CRITICAL**: Project-threatening (e.g., expropriation, environmental contamination)
- **HIGH**: Significant impact (e.g., budget overrun, timeline delay)
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate impact (e.g., tenant relocation, minor title issues)
- **LOW**: Minor impact (e.g., administrative delays)

### 6. Approvals Required

**Purpose:** Clarify authorization pathway

**Format:**
```
## Approvals Required

| Authority | Level | Threshold | Timing |
|:----------|:------|----------:|:-------|
| [Body] | [Type] | $[Amount] | [When] |
```

**Best practices:**
- List in order of approval sequence
- Include dollar thresholds to explain why approval needed
- Specify timing requirements
- Note if approvals can be concurrent vs. sequential

### 7. Action Items

**Purpose:** Define next steps with accountability

**Format:**
```
## Action Items

### High Priority

1. **[Action]**
   - Responsible: [Name/Role]
   - Deadline: [Date]

### Medium Priority
...

### Low Priority
...
```

**Best practices:**
- Group by priority (High > Medium > Low)
- Assign specific owner (name or role)
- Include realistic deadlines
- Note dependencies between actions
- Keep to 5-8 actions maximum (more = dilution)

**Priority guidelines:**
- **HIGH**: On critical path, blocks other work, time-sensitive
- **MEDIUM**: Important but not blocking, moderate timeline
- **LOW**: Administrative, long timeline, not blocking

## Best Practices

### Executive Communication Principles

**1. Lead with decision**
- Busy executives scan for "what do you need from me?"
- Put decision in title and first paragraph
- Don't bury the ask

**2. Be concise**
- 1-2 pages maximum
- Use tables for complex data
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Every word must earn its place

**3. Show trade-offs**
- Always present alternatives
- Quantify cost/benefit trade-offs
- Explain why alternatives were rejected
- Address obvious questions preemptively

**4. Mitigate risks**
- Identify material risks proactively
- Always include mitigation strategies
- Assign risk owners
- Don't pretend risks don't exist

**5. Make it actionable**
- Clear next steps with owners
- Realistic deadlines
- Show dependencies
- Define success criteria

### Common Pitfalls

**1. Too much detail**
- ❌ 10-page comprehensive analysis
- ✅ 2-page executive summary with appendices available

**2. Vague recommendations**
- ❌ "Consider acquisition of property"
- ✅ "Approve acquisition of 2550 Yonge Street at $1.85M"

**3. Hiding bad news**
- ❌ Omitting budget variance
- ✅ "Cost is $150k over budget (8.8%) but represents best value vs alternatives"

**4. Analysis without synthesis**
- ❌ Presenting data without interpretation
- ✅ "Alternative sites cost $350k-500k more all-in despite lower acquisition price"

**5. No clear action items**
- ❌ Ending with recommendation only
- ✅ Including specific next steps with owners and deadlines

### Decision Urgency Framework

**HIGH urgency:**
- Critical deadline within 60 days
- Project-blocking decision
- Market timing sensitive (e.g., appreciation, competing buyers)
- Regulatory deadline

**MEDIUM urgency:**
- Decision needed within 90 days
- Important but not blocking
- Moderate market sensitivity

**LOW urgency:**
- Decision can be deferred 90+ days
- Planning or strategic decision
- No time constraints

### Financial Presentation

**Always include:**
- Total cost (first line - executives want bottom line)
- Cost breakdown with percentages
- Budget comparison if applicable
- Funding source
- Contingency amount and percentage

**Budget variance handling:**
- If under budget: ✅ highlight savings
- If over budget: ⚠️ explain rationale and show alternatives were worse
- If significantly over (>10%): address explicitly in recommendation

**Alternatives comparison:**
- Compare total cost (not just acquisition cost)
- Include timeline impacts (delay = $)
- Show all-in economics (e.g., Alternative A: $1.4M acquisition + $800k tunnel = $2.2M total)

## Integration with Other Skills

**Complementary skills:**
- `land-assembly-expert`: Property assembly strategy for multi-parcel acquisitions
- `settlement-analysis-expert`: Negotiation vs. expropriation decision analysis
- `transit-station-site-acquisition-strategy`: Site selection for transit projects
- `expropriation-timeline-expert`: Expropriation process timelines

**Workflow integration:**
1. Use site selection skills to evaluate alternatives
2. Use settlement analysis to determine negotiation strategy
3. Use briefing-note-expert to synthesize decision for executive approval
4. Use land assembly for implementation planning

## Examples and Templates

**Sample inputs available:**
- `samples/sample_1_transit_station_acquisition.json` - Full transit station acquisition example

**Use sample as template:**
1. Copy sample JSON
2. Modify project-specific fields
3. Update financial data
4. Adjust risks and action items
5. Run generator

## Validation and Quality Checks

- [ ] Overall risk level reasonable

**Action checks:**
- [ ] 5-8 action items (not too many)
- [ ] Specific owners assigned
- [ ] Realistic deadlines
- [ ] Dependencies noted
- [ ] Critical path actions are HIGH priority

## Output Quality Standards
