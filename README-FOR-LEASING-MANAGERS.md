## It's Like Having a 20-Year Veteran Work for You—For the Price of a Claude Code Subscription

---

## Here's the Problem

You're good at what you do. You understand tenant psychology. You know when to push, when to walk, when to throw in an extra TI dollar to close by Friday. You've built relationships that take years to cultivate. You can read a market in your sleep.

But that's maybe 40% of your week.

The other 60%? You're drowning in Excel. Abstracting leases line by line. Hunting down market comps. Building board packages that nobody reads. Answering the same questions from asset managers who think a VLOOKUP error is a moral failing. Running variance reports that could've been automated in 1997.

**You became a leasing professional to do deals. Not data entry.**

And here's the thing: the people approving your deals? They don't care about your instincts. They don't care that you *know* this tenant will perform. They care about the model. The comps. The credit score. The variance decomposition. The IFRS 16 schedules that accounting needs for month-end close.

They want institutional rigor. Audit trails. Unimpeachable math.

**And they want it yesterday.**

---

## What This Is

**This is Reggie Chan.** A Vice President of Leasing & Asset Management with CFA credentials, FRICS designation, and 20+ years of institutional real estate experience—now working for you.

Just address "Reggie" and watch him:
- Evaluate lease deals with CFA-level financial analysis
- Structure responses to impossible tenant objections
- Run credit analysis that would make any asset manager nod
- Draft consent agreements, SNDAs, and surrenders
- Calculate everything from effective rent to Black-Scholes option values

Reggie gives you back two full days every week. Days you used to spend in spreadsheet purgatory. Days you can now spend closing deals, working the phones, or finally getting to that 2 p.m. tee time.

**Reggie has access to:**
- **25 automated workflows** - One command, instant output for everything from lease abstraction to IFRS 16 accounting
- **11 financial calculators** - Built by people who actually understand leasing, not consultants
- **15 expert systems** - On-demand guidance for assignments, SNDAs, indemnities, arbitration prep, objection handling

Every output is timestamped, auditable, and so clean that even your most pedantic asset manager will have to approve it. Because there's nothing to criticize.

**You hand them perfection. They hand you approval. Everyone wins.**

Except you win more, because you're on the back nine by 3 p.m.

---

## How It Works

### One Pipeline. Every Workflow.

It's stupidly simple:

1. **Feed it a lease PDF** (or DOCX, or Excel, or whatever disaster format you've been handed)
2. **Type one command** (like `/effective-rent` or `/abstract-lease` or `/tenant-credit`)
3. **Get a board-ready report** in seconds

No menus. No configuration. No "please update to the latest version." Just results.

The whole system runs on this:

**PDF → JSON → Python → Report**

Every workflow follows the same pattern. Every output lands in the same folder. Every file gets the same timestamp format. No surprises. No creativity. Just ruthless consistency.

Because the last thing you need is *more complexity*.

---

## What It Actually Does For You

### When a Tenant Sends You Financials

*Old way:* Spend 90 minutes in Excel calculating debt service coverage, current ratios, leverage multiples. Build a memo. Hope you didn't fat-finger a formula. Send it to the asset manager. Get grilled on why your numbers don't match theirs.

*New way:* Type `/tenant-credit path/to/financials.pdf`. Get back a complete credit analysis in 30 seconds. Fifteen ratios. A 100-point credit score. A recommended security deposit amount. PD/LGD estimates. Everything formatted, documented, defensible.

**You look like you have a team of analysts. You don't. You have this.**

---

### When You Need to Compare Offers

*Old way:* Build a comparison spreadsheet from scratch. Copy-paste rent schedules. Try to remember which version of the model you sent last time. Hope nobody notices the TI number changed.

*New way:* Type `/compare-offers offer1.pdf offer2.pdf`. Get a side-by-side analysis with NPV, effective rent, concession structure, and exactly which deal performs better under which assumptions.

**Decision made. Email sent. Deal closed.**

---

### When They Ask For Market Comps

*Old way:* Log into CoStar. Export to Excel. Clean the data. Try to figure out why the asking rent is $14.50 in one row and "$14.50 PSF" in another. Build a custom comparison table. Hope it doesn't break when someone opens it in Google Sheets.

*New way:* Type `/extract-mls mls_report.pdf --subject="2550 Stanfield"`. Get back a professionally formatted Excel file with your subject property highlighted, all competitors ranked, and every column clean and ready for analysis.

**No cleanup. No formatting. Just data that works.**

---

### When Finance Needs IFRS 16 Schedules

*Old way:* Try to remember the formula for present value of lease liabilities. Google "ROU asset calculation." Build an amortization table from scratch. Email it to accounting. Get told it doesn't match their model. Start over.

*New way:* Type `/ifrs16-calculation lease.pdf 5.5` (where 5.5 is your discount rate). Get back complete IFRS 16 / ASC 842 schedules, journal entries, CSV exports, everything accounting needs for month-end close.

**They say "thank you" instead of "can you fix this?"**

---

### When Your Portfolio Has An Expiry Cliff

*Old way:* Export every lease from the system. Build a pivot table. Try to figure out which leases matter most. Wing it on renewal probabilities. Send an email with "high risk" next to anything expiring soon.

*New way:* Type `/rollover-analysis portfolio.json`. Get back a complete risk dashboard: lease expiry concentrations, priority scoring (based on rent contribution, urgency, and credit rating), three-scenario modeling, action plan for Q1/Q2/Q3.

**Your boss thinks you've been doing strategic planning. You typed one command.**

---

### When They Want To Know If The Termination Option Is Worth It

*Old way:* Stare at the clause. Make an educated guess. Hope it doesn't come up again.

*New way:* Type `/option-value lease.pdf`. Get back a Black-Scholes valuation of the embedded option, Greeks (Delta, Vega, Theta), probability in-the-money, sensitivity analysis.

**Now you can negotiate like you actually know the math. Because you do.**

---

## Every Analysis You'll Ever Need

### The 24 Workflows

We built these for the questions you get asked every single week. One command, instant output, zero thinking required.

**Abstraction** (2 commands)
- `/abstract-lease` – Pull every term from a lease into a clean 24-section template

**Financial Analysis** (10 commands)
- `/effective-rent` – NER, GER, NPV, breakeven, Ponzi Rental Rate, sensitivities
- `/tenant-credit` – Full credit analysis with ratios, score, security recommendation
- `/rental-variance` – Budget vs. actuals decomposition (rate, area, term)
- `/market-comparison` – Benchmark rent against comps, calculate pricing gap
- `/rollover-analysis` – Portfolio expiry risk dashboard with action plan
- `/option-value` – Real options valuation for flexibility clauses
- `/renewal-economics` – Renewal vs. relocation recommendation matrix

**Accounting** (1 command)
- `/ifrs16-calculation` – IFRS 16 / ASC 842 schedules and journal entries

**Comparison** (4 commands)
- `/compare-amendment` – Amendment vs. original lease summary
- `/compare-offers` – Side-by-side economics for multiple offers
- `/compare-precedent` – Deviations from your standard form
- `/lease-vs-lease` – Clause-by-clause comparison

**Compliance** (7 commands)
- `/assignment-consent` – Consent package checklist and risk analysis
- `/default-analysis` – Default provisions and cure period breakdown
- `/environmental-compliance` – Environmental obligations summary
- `/estoppel-certificate` – Draft estoppel populated from lease abstract
- `/insurance-audit` – Insurance requirement verification
- `/notice-generator` – Draft lease notices (renewal, termination, default)
- `/work-letter` – Work letter outline from TI provisions

Every single one of these used to be a half-day project. Now they're 30 seconds.

**That's 48 hours back in your week. Do the math.**

### The 11 Calculators

When you need to go deeper or customize the analysis, you can run the calculators directly. Same inputs, same outputs, just more control.

1. **Effective Rent Calculator** – NER/GER, NPV, PRR, breakeven, payback, sensitivity
2. **Rental Yield Curve** – Term structure modeling with implied termination options
3. **Rental Variance Analysis** – Budget vs. actuals decomposition (audit-ready)
4. **Relative Valuation Engine** – Competitive ranking across 25 variables with 4 tenant personas
5. **IFRS 16 / ASC 842 Calculator** – Lease liability, ROU asset, schedules, journal entries
6. **Tenant Credit Analysis** – 15+ ratios, 100-point score, PD/LGD, security recommendation
7. **Renewal Economics** – Renewal vs. relocation NPV comparison
8. **Portfolio Rollover Calculator** – Lease expiry aggregation with concentration risk flags
9. **Default Damage Calculator** – Landlord damages quantification for tenant defaults
10. **Statistical Analysis Module** – Regression, correlation, outlier detection (for large datasets)
11. **Real Options Valuation Calculator** – Black-Scholes pricing for lease flexibility

Each one has been tested on real deals. 235+ passing tests. No surprises.

### The 15 Expert Advisors

Some questions don't have a formula. They need judgment. Experience. A senior advisor who's seen this exact situation 50 times.

That's what the skills are. On-demand expertise for the messy stuff.

**Core Leasing**
- `commercial-lease-expert` – Deal structuring, net lease mechanics, negotiation strategy

**Security & Protection**
- `indemnity-expert` – Indemnity agreements, bankruptcy-proof provisions
- `non-disturbance-expert` – SNDA agreements, foreclosure protection

**Lease Modifications & Transfers**
- `consent-to-assignment-expert` – Assignment consent, privity analysis
- `consent-to-sublease-expert` – Sublease consent, three-party structures
- `share-transfer-consent-expert` – Change of control, corporate restructuring
- `lease-surrender-expert` – Early termination, mutual release

**Preliminary & Ancillary Agreements**
- `offer-to-lease-expert` – Offers to lease, LOIs, term sheets
- `waiver-agreement-expert` – Conditional waivers, counter-offers
- `temporary-license-expert` – Short-term licenses (1 day to 3 months)
- `storage-agreement-expert` – Storage lockers, ancillary space

**Specialized Licenses**
- `telecom-licensing-expert` – Carrier access, CRTC compliance

**Dispute Resolution**
- `lease-arbitration-expert` – Arbitration agreements, rent determination

**Negotiation & Objection Handling**
- `negotiation-expert` – Evidence-based persuasion, calibrated questions, accusation audits
- `objection-handling-expert` – Systematic objection analysis, response strategies, value creation

Each one gives you checklists, negotiation angles, risk flags, and recommended language. Basically, it's like having a senior partner on speed dial, except they respond instantly and never bill you.

The negotiation skills are different. They don't just tell you what to do—they show you **how to say it**. When a broker pushes back on rent, you don't defend your number. You ask: *"How am I supposed to justify $16/sf when every comparable property built after 2015 is leasing for $18-19?"* Now they're the ones doing the work. That's evidence-based persuasion, adapted for commercial real estate.

## Who This Is For

### If You're a Leasing Manager at a REIT

You're juggling 40 leases, half of which expire in the next 18 months. Finance wants variance reports. Asset management wants rollover risk analysis. Your boss wants to know why the Q3 renewals are below budget.

**This gives you the reporting infrastructure of a 10-person team. For free.**

---

### If You're a Property Manager

You need to abstract every lease, track critical dates, handle assignment consents, draft default notices, and somehow find time to actually manage the building.

**This automates the paperwork so you can do the actual job.**

---

### If You're a Corporate Real Estate Manager

Your CFO wants IFRS 16 compliance. Your VP wants lease-vs-buy analysis. Your FP&A team wants renewal economics modeled three different ways.

**This speaks fluent CFO. You just point it at the lease.**

---

### If You're a Broker or Advisor

You're pitching deals. You need offer comps, market analysis, effective rent breakdowns, and everything has to look institutional-grade because your client's investment committee doesn't mess around.

**This is your unfair advantage. Use it.**

---

## What Makes This Different

### It Was Built By People Who Understand Leasing

Not by someone who thinks "TI" stands for "Texas Instruments."

Not by a team of engineers who have never seen a Schedule G.

Not by consultants billing $400/hour to build you a model you can't modify.

**This was built by someone who actually does this work.** Someone who knows that "net effective rent" and "gross effective rent" are different things. Someone who understands that a renewal analysis isn't complete unless you model relocation downtime. Someone who knows that variance decomposition means rate, area, *and term*.

Every calculator reflects real-world assumptions. Every workflow follows actual deal flow. Every output matches what an asset manager expects to see.

**It just works. Because it was built by people who know what "works" means.**

---

### It's Tested on Real Deals

235+ passing tests. Not toy examples. Real lease structures. Real cash flows. Real edge cases.

What happens if there's no free rent? Tested.
What if the TI is paid over 24 months instead of upfront? Tested.
What if the lease has a termination option in year 3? Tested.
What if the discount rate is negative? (Okay, that one's theoretical. But still tested.)

**You're not the beta tester. This has already been through the fire.**

---

### It Speaks Asset Manager

You know what asset managers love? Consistency. Auditability. Timestamps. Formulas they can trace back to first principles.

You know what they hate? "Trust me." Circular references. Models that break when you change one cell.

**Every output from this toolkit is asset-manager-proof.**

Clean JSON inputs. Documented assumptions. Timestamped reports. CSV exports for Excel jockeys. Markdown for everyone else.

No black boxes. No magic. Just math you can defend in a room full of skeptics.

---

### It Gives You Time Back

Here's what two extra days a week gets you:

- Close three more deals this quarter (hello, commission)
- Actually return phone calls the same day
- Stop working weekends
- Take a real vacation without drowning when you get back
- Finally learn what "work-life balance" means

Or just play more golf. We don't judge.

**Either way, you're not spending it in Excel.**

## Getting Started Is Stupid Simple

### Installation (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Install Claude Code**

This toolkit runs on Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI. Install it first:

```bash
# Install Claude Code (follow instructions at https://docs.claude.com/claude-code)
# For most systems:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reggiechan74/leasing-expert.git
cd leasing-expert
```

**Step 3: Let Claude Code Install Everything Else**

Open Claude Code in the repository directory and tell it:

```
Install all the dependencies for this project
```

Claude Code will automatically install:
- Python dependencies (numpy, pandas, scipy, openpyxl, pytest, markitdown)
- PDF generation tools (pandoc, wkhtmltopdf)
- Everything else you need

That's it. No manual pip commands. No hunting for dependencies. No "works on my machine" problems. Claude Code handles it all.

---

### Your First Workflow (30 seconds)

```bash
# Abstract a lease
/abstract-lease path/to/lease.docx

# Analyze effective rent
/effective-rent path/to/lease.pdf

# Extract market comps
/extract-mls path/to/mls_report.pdf --subject="2550 Stanfield"
```

Every report lands in the `Reports/` folder with a timestamp. Open it. Send it. Done.

---

### Running Calculators Directly

If you want more control, skip the workflows and run the calculators yourself:

```bash
# Effective rent analysis
python Eff_Rent_Calculator/eff_rent_calculator.py input.json

# Credit scoring
python Credit_Analysis/run_credit_analysis.py financials.json

# IFRS 16 accounting
python IFRS16_Calculator/run_ifrs16_analysis.py lease_data.json

# Portfolio rollover risk
python Rollover_Analysis/rollover_calculator.py portfolio.json

# Real options valuation
python Option_Valuation/option_valuation.py inputs.json --verbose
```

Same inputs. Same outputs. More flexibility.

---

## What This Costs

**Nothing.**

Zero subscription fees. Zero per-user licensing. Zero "contact sales for enterprise pricing."

It's open source. Apache 2.0 license. Use it. Modify it. Build on it. Ship it to your entire team.

We're not selling you software. We're giving you time back.

**Do something useful with it.**

---

## What This Isn't

Let's be clear about a few things:

**This is not legal advice.** If you need a lawyer, hire a lawyer. This toolkit helps you analyze deals, not practice law.

**This is not accounting advice.** The IFRS 16 calculator gives you the schedules. Your accountant signs off on them.

**This is not investment advice.** The models are tools. The decisions are yours.

**This is not a replacement for judgment.** If a tenant's financials show a 5.0 debt service coverage ratio but you know they're about to lose their biggest customer, don't lease to them just because the model says "low risk."

**Garbage in, garbage out still applies.** Clean inputs = clean outputs. Messy inputs = messy outputs. Math can't fix bad data.

Use this toolkit to do your job faster and better. But you're still the one doing the job.

---

## The Fine Print Nobody Reads (But You Should)

- Every output must be independently verified by qualified professionals
- Users remain responsible for regulatory compliance and professional judgment
- This toolkit is provided "as is" with no warranties (see LICENSE for details)
- If you break something, you own both pieces
- Use at your own risk

**Translation:** We built this to help. Not to replace thinking.

---

## What's Next

We're not done. Here's what's coming:

1. **Automated comps ingestion** – Pull market data automatically instead of manually
2. **Tenant mix optimization** – Portfolio-level analysis of lease concentration risk
3. **API integrations** – DistanceMatrix.ai, CoStar, LoopNet for real-time data
4. **Machine learning weight optimization** – Learn from your historical deal outcomes

But here's the thing: **this already works.** Version 1.7.0 is production-ready. You can use it today.

Don't wait for perfection. Start saving time now.

---

## One Last Thing

Remember why you got into this business.

It wasn't to become an Excel expert. It wasn't to spend your Fridays building variance reports. It wasn't to fight with your asset manager over a 2% NPV difference.

**It was to do deals.**

To create value. To build relationships. To see an empty building and envision a thriving tenant. To negotiate like a professional and close like a champion.

This toolkit doesn't do that for you. But it clears the path so you can.

**Get back to what you're actually good at.**

The spreadsheets can wait. The deals can't.
