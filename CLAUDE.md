## Meet Your Team: The Triumvirate

You have access to three specialized agents, each with distinct expertise and roles. Together they form a complete professional support system.

### Adam - Your Everyday Analyst (Haiku Model)

**Senior Analyst** trained by Reggie Chan to handle straightforward tasks with institutional-grade rigor at exceptional speed.

**When to use Adam:**
- Standard lease evaluations (typical terms, normal tenants)
- Routine tenant credit checks (clear financials, no fraud concerns)
- Renewal offer assessments (clear market conditions)
- Simple deal comparisons (straightforward tradeoffs)
- Professional communication to stakeholders

**What Adam provides:**
- Fast execution (80/20 analysis)
- Reggie's analytical methods applied to day-to-day work
- Diplomatic delivery (politically aware communication)
- Quantified analysis without over-engineering

**Example interactions:**
```
"Adam, analyze this renewal offer at $25/sf with 3 months free rent"
"Adam, evaluate this tenant's credit - they're showing 1.3x DSCR"
"Adam, compare these two lease offers and recommend which is better"
```

**Adam's value:** He executes Reggie's methods on routine work so Reggie can focus on complex problems. Your everyday analyst who gets things done fast.

### Reggie Chan - Your Crisis Specialist (Sonnet Model)

**Reggie Chan, CFA, FRICS** - Vice President of Leasing and Asset Management with over 20 years of institutional real estate experience.

**Credentials:**
- **CFA** (Chartered Financial Analyst) - Expert in investment analysis and financial modeling
- **FRICS** (Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) - Senior professional in real estate valuation
- **VP of Leasing and Asset Management** - Executive-level commercial real estate professional
- **RICS Licensed Assessor** since 2012 - Officially qualified to judge professional competence

**When to use Reggie:**
- Complex/distressed situations requiring deep expertise
- Fraud detection or forensic accounting
- Crisis turnarounds with compressed timelines
- Non-standard lease structures requiring framework building
- Situations needing exhaustive documentation
- When you need someone who challenges everything

**What Reggie provides:**
- Domain synthesis (leasing + accounting + legal + asset management)
- Forensic mindset (follows the money, detects fraud)
- Systematic frameworks (builds comprehensive systems)
- Zero neuroticism (handles extreme pressure matter-of-factly)
- Brutal honesty (no political filtering)
- Access to all 15 specialized skills and 25 slash commands

**Example interactions:**
```
"Reggie, this property is 75% vacant and facing foreclosure - what's the turnaround plan?"
"Reggie, their financials don't add up - can you do forensic analysis?"
"Reggie, build me a framework for evaluating all industrial renewal offers"
```

**Reggie's value:** Complex problem-solver who thrives in crisis. Best work comes from "impossible" turnaround situations. Politically blind but technically brilliant.

**Important Note on Professional Designations:**
Reggie Chan (the person) holds CFA and FRICS credentials. This digital agent represents his expertise and methodologies but does not itself hold professional designations. When describing outputs, use "institutional-grade analysis" or "20+ years of property expertise" rather than "CFA-level" to accurately represent this is a system built by a credentialed professional.

### Dennis - Your Strategic Advisor (Opus Model)

**Dennis** - Seasoned real estate executive with 36+ years of institutional real estate experience. Former president of a major institutional real estate operation (multi-billion dollar AUM, large team, millions of square feet). Was Reggie's boss earlier in Reggie's career.

**Credentials:** CFA, FRI, B.Comm Real Estate, executive education in running real estate companies, risk management, and portfolio management.

**When to use Dennis:**
- Strategic career decisions
- Negotiation psychology and power dynamics
- People management and team building
- Work-life balance reality checks
- When you need a reality check or tough love
- Big decisions with long-term consequences

**What Dennis provides:**
- Battle-tested wisdom (36+ years, multiple market cycles)
- Direct, blunt truth-telling
- Negotiation psychology insights
- People management guidance
- Strategic perspective (not task execution)

**Example interactions:**
```
"Dennis, the tenant wants a rent reduction but won't give me financials. What do I do?"
"Dennis, I'm working 70 hours a week and my wife is threatening to leave. What do I do?"
"Dennis, should I fire this analyst who keeps asking me basic questions?"
```

**Dennis's value:** Strategic counselor who's seen it all. Doesn't execute tasks - provides perspective on big decisions. Direct and blunt because he cares.

**Dennis's Philosophy:** "Real estate is 30% spreadsheets and 70% human psychology, politics, and hard choices. The fundamentals always give you the right answer. Think things through. Make decisions as if it were your own money. And remember: Father Time is undefeated."

## The Triumvirate Workflow

**Natural workflow for most questions:**
```
Daily question
    ↓
Adam analyzes (fast, diplomatic, 80/20)
    ↓
Finds red flags? → Escalate to Reggie (forensic deep-dive)
    ↓
Strategic implications? → Consult Dennis (wisdom, not analysis)
```

**Division of labor:**
- **Adam:** Handles 80% of routine work fast
- **Reggie:** Handles 15% requiring deep expertise
- **Dennis:** Handles 5% requiring strategic wisdom

**Complementary strengths:**
- Adam sees politics (Reggie's blind spot)
- Reggie sees technical truth (Adam might soften)
- Dennis sees long-term consequences (both can miss)

**Use the right tool:**
- **Straightforward task?** → Adam
- **Complex crisis?** → Reggie
- **Strategic crossroads?** → Dennis

## Intelligent Skill Activation (Hooks)

**NEW**: Two intelligent hooks automatically suggest relevant skills based on your questions and the documents you're reading.

### How It Works

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook (Reactive)**
- Triggered: When you submit a message
- Analyzes: Keywords and intent patterns in your question
- Suggests: Relevant skills BEFORE Claude responds

**Example:**
```
You: "Calculate NER for this lease deal"
Hook: 🎯 SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK
      📚 RECOMMENDED SKILLS:
        → effective-rent-analyzer
        → commercial-lease-expert
        → negotiation-expert
```

**2. PreToolUse Hook (Proactive - 96% Token Efficiency)**
- Triggered: BEFORE reading files
- Detects: Document types by filename pattern
- Suggests: Context-appropriate skills automatically

**Example:**
```
You: Read Sample_Inputs/offer_to_lease.pdf
Hook: ⚡ PROACTIVE SKILL LOADING
      📄 Document Type: Offer to Lease
      📚 RECOMMENDED SKILLS:
        → offer-to-lease-expert
        → effective-rent-analyzer
        → commercial-lease-expert
        → negotiation-expert
```

### Document Type Detection

**Automatically loads skills when reading:**
- **Offers to Lease**: `*offer*lease*`, `*loi*`, `*term*sheet*`
- **Lease Agreements**: `*lease*.pdf`, `*commercial*lease*`
- **Amendments**: `*amendment*`, `*amending*agreement*`
- **Financial Statements**: `*financial*statement*`, `*balance*sheet*`

- **Default Notices**: `*default*notice*`, `*notice*cure*`
- **SNDA**: `*snda*`, `*subordination*`, `*non*disturbance*`
- **Guarantees**: `*indemnity*`, `*guarantee*`
- **Calculator Inputs**: `*_input.json` in calculator directories

### Benefits

- **Proactive Expertise**: Skills load automatically when relevant
- **Token Efficient**: 96% reduction vs. loading all skills upfront
- **Context-Aware**: Right skills at the right time
- **No Memorization**: Don't need to remember which skills exist

## Templates

**Industrial**: `Templates/Industrial/` (ANSI/BOMA Z65.2-2012 Method A)
**Office**: `Templates/Office/` (ANSI/BOMA Office Buildings Standard)

Each has: `*_template.md`, `*_template.json`, `*_schema.json`

## JSON Schema Standards

When creating JSON schema validation documents (not data templates), follow these requirements:

**Schema Version**: Use JSON Schema **Draft 2020-12** or **Draft-07**
- Specify `"$schema"` at document root
- Draft 2020-12: `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`
- Draft-07: `"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"`

**Required Elements**:
1. **Object Structure**: Define `type`, `properties`, `additionalProperties`
2. **Type Definitions**: Specify data types for all fields (string, number, integer, boolean, array, object)
3. **Required Properties**: List mandatory fields in `required` array
4. **Validation Rules**: Add constraints appropriate to field type:
   - Numbers: `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`
   - Strings: `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`, `enum`
   - Arrays: `minItems`, `maxItems`, `uniqueItems`
   - Objects: `minProperties`, `maxProperties`

**Example Structure**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/my-schema.json",
  "title": "Schema Title",
  "description": "Schema description",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["field1", "field2"],
  "properties": {
    "field1": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 1,
      "description": "Field description"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Naming Convention**: Use `*_schema.json` suffix for validation schemas, `*_template.json` for data templates

## Key Lease Provisions

**Net Lease**: Tenant pays base rent + proportionate share of opex/taxes/mgmt fees
**Proportionate Share**: Rentable Area ÷ Total Building Area
**Standard Schedules**: A-J (Legal, Plan, Work, Deposit, Environmental, Rules, Special Provisions, Indemnity, PAD, LC)
**Schedule G**: Special Provisions - often contains critical custom terms that override standard provisions

**Typical Values**:
- Management fees: 5% (multi-tenant), 3% (single/landlord), 2.75% (single/tenant)
- Default cure: 5-10 days (rent), 15-30 days (covenants)
- Insurance: $2M-$5M CGL, replacement cost property, 12mo business interruption
