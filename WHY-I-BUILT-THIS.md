# Why I Built This

## I Used to Be the Problem

Let me be honest about who I was.

I was the spreadsheet guy. The numbers guy.  The asset manager who sat on the other side of the table and crapped all over the leasing team when their math didn't add up.

"Your NER calculation is wrong."
"This deal is cash-flow negative after debt service."
"Did you even pull comps, or are you just guessing?"

I was *that guy*. The one who could build any model you wanted. The one who could tell you the IRR to three decimal places but couldn't close a deal to save his life. The one who lived in Excel and avoided broker calls like the plague.

I was good at math. Terrible at people. And proud of the distinction.

**That was 2012.**

By 2020, the team went from six people down to one.

Me.

## Then Reality Hit

Suddenly, I wasn't just the asset manager anymore. I was asset management *and* leasing. Strategic *and* tactical. Models *and* phone calls. Analysis *and* negotiation.

The same guy who used to mock leasing professionals for being "bad at math" now had to *be* a leasing professional. While still doing all the asset management work. Alone.

**Here's what that actually meant:**

- 40 properties. 4 million square feet. Industrial and office.
- 100+ lease transactions over those final two years alone
- Every deal from 1,000 sf to 318,000 sf
- Every tenant from mom-and-pop to Fortune 500
- Market analysis. Tenant negotiations. Broker management. Legal reviews. Financial modeling. Board packages. Monthly reporting. Budget variance analysis. VTS implementation. Development projects.

Oh, and we need you to outperform the market, maintain institutional rigor, and keep delivering board-ready packages that won't get shredded by the investment committee.

**No pressure.**

I had two choices: drown, or build systems that would let me scale.

I built systems.

## The Spreadsheet Monk Learns to Fight

Here's the thing nobody tells you about going from pure asset management to operations: you can't just "work harder."

The math doesn't work. There aren't enough hours.

If I spent the time doing proper market analysis on every deal the way I used to demand from the leasing team, I'd get through maybe 20 transactions a year. I was averaging 50.

So I built workflows. I built templates. I built decision frameworks. I built automation before automation was cool.

**Every single tool in this repository is something I built to survive.**

### The Competitive Pricing Model

Remember that 51% weighted average rent increase I achieved in 2020 when the market average was 26%?

That wasn't instinct. That wasn't "market feel." That was a feature-weighted comp matrix in Excel that I rebuilt every week:

- Clear height (20% weight)
- Parking ratio (15%)
- Office percentage (10%)
- Dock doors (15%)
- Location/access (20%)
- Building age/condition (20%)

I tracked every competitor on MLS. Pure Industrial. Everyone. I knew their asking rents. I knew their features. I ran the adjustments. I priced $0.25/sf below the market leader after normalization.

**And I closed deals faster than anyone because I had the math to back up every number.**

That model is now the Relative Valuation Engine in this toolkit. Automated. Reproducible. 25 variables instead of 6.

### The Ponzi Rental Rate

You know what I discovered when I actually had to negotiate deals instead of just analyzing them?

Net Effective Rent is a lie.

Or at least, it's incomplete. It doesn't account for debt service. It doesn't account for capital recovery. It doesn't tell you if a deal that's "above budget" is actually cash-flow positive after you pay the mortgage and the dividend.

So I wrote a paper about it. "Understanding the Ponzi Rental Rate" (Journal of Real Estate Finance, Fall 2015). Fully-levered breakeven analysis. Band of Investment. Inwood sinking fund for capital recovery.

**It's not theory. It's how I approved every single deal.**

That framework is now the Effective Rent Calculator in this toolkit. The thing that tells you if a deal actually makes money or if it's just financial engineering that looks good in Year 1.

### The VTS Implementation

Here's how lease approvals used to work: PDF offers. Physical signatures. Email chains. DocuSign. Two months from handshake to executed lease.

When you're doing 50+ transactions a year solo, that's a death sentence.

So I championed the VTS implementation. Full digital workflow. Automated routing. Version control. Real-time pipeline visibility. Integration with accounting.

**We went from 60 days average to 30 days.** 90% adoption in the first month. Deals closed within monthly reporting cycles instead of dragging across quarters.

VTS gave me "Rookie of the Year" customer award in May 2019.

I gave them a case study in what happens when you let an engineer run operations.

### The 2145 Dunwin Conversion

And then there was the development project.

52,000 sf office building. Lost the anchor tenant. Parking was constrained (3 spaces per 1,000 sf when medical needs 6). Market for office was soft.

**Solution: Convert it to condos.**

40 units. $20 million project value. I was asset manager, development manager, and project lead.

I hired the architect, the planner, the engineers, the lawyers, the brokers. I managed the construction. I navigated the Ontario Condominium Act. I dealt with the parking declaration crisis that almost killed the project 72 hours before closing.

**97.5% sold by completion. Profitable returns above pro forma.**

The same guy who used to hide from broker calls was now running a multi-million dollar development project and negotiating with condo buyers.

## What I Learned

**You can be good at math AND good at deals.**

You can be institutional AND fast.

You can have rigorous analytics AND close in 30 days.

You can be a spreadsheet guy AND a people person.

**But only if you have systems.**

Systems that scale you. Systems that take the repetitive work and make it instant. Systems that let you spend your time on the things that actually matter—understanding the tenant, reading the market, structuring the win-win—instead of rebuilding the same Excel model for the 47th time.

## Why I'm Giving This Away

These aren't theory. These aren't consultant frameworks built in a vacuum by people who've never closed a deal.

**These are the actual tools I used to:**

- Achieve 51% WARI when the market was doing 26%
- Complete 700+ transactions across 4 million square feet
- Outperform the market as a solo operator doing the work of six people
- Go from $90k manager to $184k VP because the results were undeniable
- Win VTS Rookie of the Year while publishing academic research
- Increase industrial portfolio value by 141% when the market grew 35%

Every calculator here has run real deals. Every workflow has closed real transactions. Every framework has survived real investment committee meetings where the CFO asked hard questions and the math had to hold up.

**This is nine years of operational knowledge, battle-tested and refined.**

And I'm giving it away freely. Modernized for the AI age with Claude Code automation. Open source. Apache 2.0 license.

Why?

Because the industry doesn't need more people choosing between being good at spreadsheets or good at deals.

We need people who can do both.

We need leasing professionals who can run the numbers so well that the asset managers shut up and approve the deal.

We need asset managers who understand operations so well that they stop building impossible models that have nothing to do with reality.

**We need fewer spreadsheet monks and more people who can actually get deals done.**

## The Irony Isn't Lost on Me

I started as the guy who looked down on leasing professionals for being "bad at math."

Then I became a leasing professional who had to live by the math every single day.

Now I'm the guy building tools so you don't have to choose.

So you can be rigorous AND fast.
So you can be analytical AND human.
So you can satisfy the asset manager's need for perfect models AND the broker's need to close by Friday.

**This toolkit is the bridge I built between those two worlds.**

It's every competitive pricing model I ever built.
It's every breakeven calculation I ever ran.
It's every renewal analysis framework I ever created.
It's every negotiation template I ever refined.
It's every market comp methodology I ever systematized.

All automated. All reproducible. All free.

## What This Actually Is

This isn't software.

It's institutional knowledge that used to be locked in my head, my spreadsheets, my email templates, and my battle scars.

It's the answer to "how did you do that alone?"

It's the toolkit that turned one person into six.

**It's what I wish I had in 2012 when I was still the spreadsheet guy who didn't understand why leasing was so hard.**

Now you have it.

Use it. Modify it. Build on it. Make it better.

And maybe, just maybe, you'll get back to doing what you're actually good at.

**Closing deals. Not building spreadsheets.**
